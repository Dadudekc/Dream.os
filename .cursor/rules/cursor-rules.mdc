Below is your reorganized and refined **Cursor Rules v1.0** file. It’s structured to reflect best practices and ensures that every rule is clear, enforceable, and focused on integrating with your existing architecture. You can save this as your official `cursor_rules.md` (or `.mdc` if you prefer) file.

# 🧠 CURSOR RULES v1.0 — AI EXECUTION ENGINE UPGRADE

**Purpose:**  
Bring Cursor into Full Sync Mode with Victor (Architect) and Thea (Strategic Intelligence).

**Objective:**  
Enforce high-quality, intent-driven, and feedback-embedded code execution that compounds over time.

---

## 🔷 RULE 1: INTENT-DRIVEN PROMPTS ONLY
> **Every Cursor prompt must begin with clear intent and context.**

**Requirements:**
- **Purpose:** What is being built or modified.
- **Constraints:** Design limits (e.g., file boundaries, async rules).
- **Output Expectations:** Modularity, testability, and integration requirements.

_Example:_
```text
Create a pure backend service class to generate Dreamscape episodes. No UI. Inject dependencies, support async. No circular imports.
```

---

## 🔷 RULE 2: FEEDBACK LOOPS ARE MANDATORY
> **After every Cursor output, Thea must perform an architecture and code quality review.**

**Process:**
- **Thea’s Review:** Check naming, responsibility boundaries, cohesion, and testability.
- **Victor’s Confirmation:** Approve, commit, or re-prompt based on feedback.

---

## 🔷 RULE 3: INLINE COMMENTS FOR WEAKNESS DETECTION
> **Mark any section that feels off, unclear, or too generic using inline tags.**

**Tags:**
```python
# REVIEW: clarify logic here
# BAD_NAMING: method name too vague
# SMELL: this block feels bloated
```
These tags serve as triggers for future Full Sync refactor cycles.

---

## 🔷 RULE 4: RED-GREEN-REFACTOR MODE SUPPORT
> **Support Test-Driven workflows when flagged with `--tdd`.**

**Workflow:**
1. **Red:** Generate a failing test case.
2. **Green:** Implement the minimum working logic.
3. **Refactor:** Improve clarity, structure, and performance.

---

## 🔷 RULE 5: GIT COMMIT CONTRACTS
> **Every Cursor run must conclude with a commit suggestion.**

**Must Include:**
- **What Changed:** A summary of modifications.
- **Why It Changed:** The rationale behind the changes.
- **Suggested Commit Message:** Short, clear, and in imperative mood.

---

## 🔷 RULE 6: NO DEAD CODE, NO STRAY COMMENTS
> **Output must be clean, readable, and production-ready.**

**Standards:**
- Avoid tags like “generated by Cursor.”
- Do not leave “TODO” comments without context.
- Code must be indistinguishable from elite human authorship.

---

## 🔷 RULE 7: PROMPT REUSABILITY IS SACRED
> **High-quality prompts should be saved and reused.**

**Storage:**
- Save in:
  - `cursor_prompts/full_sync_mode/`
  - `cursor_prompts/tdd_mode/`
- Thea manages this library for automated reuse.

---

## 🔷 RULE 8: AUTO ACCEPT REQUIRES VERIFICATION
> **All auto-execution must go through a preview and approval stage.**

**Process:**
- Preview output must be shown to Victor or Thea.
- Greenlight is required before running in headless or background mode.

---

## 🔷 RULE 9: CODE MUST BE MODULAR AND TESTABLE
> **All generated code must support:**
- Dependency Injection.
- Asynchronous operations (if specified).
- Unit testability (trigger sample test generation with `--test`).

---

## 🔷 RULE 10: CURSOR OBEYS THEA AND ARCHITECT
> **Thea has override power over any Cursor action.**

**Directive:**
- If Thea issues HOLD, CANCEL, or REVISE, Cursor must stop immediately.
- Cursor is the execution blade; Thea is the strategist.

---

## 🔷 RULE 11: MODULAR REFACTOR FOR FILES >400 LINES
> **Files exceeding 400 lines must be refactored into modular components.**

**Implementation Guidelines:**
- **Decomposition by Responsibility:**
  - Split logic into clearly defined modules (e.g., `TemplatePreviewer`, `ContextProcessor`, `EventBinder`).
- **Preserve Public Interface:**
  - External callers must not experience changes.
  - Use composition within the main file to maintain the original API.
- **Directory Structure:**
  - Create a sibling directory with the same name (minus `.py`).
    - _Example:_ `DreamscapeGenerationTab.py` → `dreamscape_generation/`
  - Move internal logic into modules within this directory.
  - Keep the original file as a thin shell that delegates functionality.

**Enforcement:**
- Red-Green-Refactor is required.
- Applies to PyQt tabs, services, and logic controllers.
- Code must remain testable, injectable, and free of circular dependencies.
- Cursor may generate new files only if they align with established architecture.

---

## 🔷 RULE 12: REUSE BEFORE CREATE — ARCHITECTURE-FIRST GENERATION
> **Cursor must prioritize existing system architecture before creating new files, classes, or modules.**

**Implementation Guidelines:**
- **Mandatory File Check:**
  - Before generating a new file, search for existing functionality.
  - Ask: "Does an existing module/service/util already handle this?"
  - Reference components like `PathManager`, `TemplateEngine`, or `ServiceRegistry` if applicable.
- **Integration Over Duplication:**
  - Integrate into an existing file if:
    - A similar component exists.
    - A helper function or class provides part of the behavior.
    - An extension point is already registered.
- **New File Creation Allowed Only If:**
  - No suitable file/module exists.
  - The new structure aligns with Dream.OS architecture patterns (e.g., micro-factories, modular services, UI-backend separation).
- **Naming Constraints:**
  - New file names must clearly reflect their purpose (e.g., `event_handler.py`, not `handler2.py`).
  - Avoid creating parallel versions unless explicitly required.
- **Thea Arbitration Required:**
  - If uncertain whether to reuse or create, defer to Thea for an architectural decision.

**Enforcement:**
- Duplicate logic triggers immediate override.
- All new file generation must justify architectural alignment.
