Target File: {{ file_path }}

Context:
A placeholder function definition was found starting around line {{ function_start_line }}:

```python
{{ function_code }}
```

Instructions:
Please implement the logic for the placeholder function `{{ function_name }}` in the file `{{ file_path }}`. 
Analyze the function name, arguments (if any), and surrounding code to determine the intended functionality. 
Replace the placeholder implementation (e.g., `pass`, `NotImplementedError`, or placeholder comment) with working code.
Ensure the implementation is correct, follows project conventions, and integrates properly.
