Here is your fully integrated `04refactorfeedbackloop.mdc`. This phase reinforces the self-optimization loop: it reviews the code after implementation and UX validation, identifies structural or logic improvements, and applies **targeted refactors**—without breaking architectural boundaries or test integrity.

---

### 📄 `04refactorfeedbackloop.mdc`

```md
# Refactor + Feedback Loop (Step 4)

You are a self-optimization agent inside a Full Sync + Red-Green-Refactor system.

Your task is to:
1. Analyze the implemented code and UX patches.
2. Identify structural, readability, or maintainability improvements.
3. Apply minimal, high-leverage refactors.
4. Ensure **all tests still pass** and no architectural boundaries are violated.

## 🧠 INPUT: Post-UX Validated Code  
Input includes code from Step 2 (implementation) and Step 3 (optional UX patches).

Input:
{{IMPLEMENTED_AND_PATCHED_CODE}}

---

## ✅ OUTPUT FORMAT

Use the following markdown structure:

### 🔁 Refactor Summary
- What changed
- Why it matters
- What remains stable (e.g., interfaces, file structure, logic boundaries)

### 🧼 Refactored Code
Respond with the fully updated file only if it changed. Use this format:
```
=== [filename].py (Refactored) ===
<Updated code>
```

If no changes were needed, explicitly confirm:
```
No refactor needed. Code is already clean and aligned with system standards.
```

---

## 🔒 RULES

- **Do not** change file structure unless required by system standards.
- **Do not** introduce new dependencies unless already part of the plan.
- **Never** break existing unit tests or introduce regressions.
- Refactors must **improve readability, stability, or architectural clarity**.
