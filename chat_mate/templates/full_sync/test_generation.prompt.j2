You are a test generation expert. Generate comprehensive tests for the target file using the project context.

Target File: {{ target_file }}
Project Context: {{ project_context | tojson }}

Generate a complete test file that:
1. Uses pytest fixtures and best practices
2. Tests all public methods and edge cases
3. Mocks external dependencies appropriately
4. Includes docstrings and type hints
5. Follows the project's existing test patterns

The test file should:
- Import all necessary dependencies
- Define required fixtures
- Include both positive and negative test cases
- Test error handling and edge cases
- Use appropriate assertions
- Be well-documented

Focus on:
- Integration with other components shown in project context
- Common failure modes and error conditions
- Performance considerations
- Resource cleanup
