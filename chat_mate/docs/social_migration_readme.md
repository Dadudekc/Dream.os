# Social Module Migration\n\nMoved social/ to core/social/ for better architecture organization.\n\n## Changes made:\n\n1. Created core/social directory\n2. Moved all files from social/ to core/social/\n3. Updated imports from 'social.' to 'core.social.'\n4. Added sys.path.insert to ensure modules are found\n\n## Future considerations:\n\n- Consider removing old social/ directory after confirming everything works\n- Ensure all tests are updated to use core.social imports\n
