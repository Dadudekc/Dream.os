Okay, so I need to create comprehensive and runnable unit tests for this Python code using the unittest module. The user also mentioned including edge cases and mocking external dependencies. Hmm, let's break this down.

First, looking at the code provided. There are two main classes: SimpleDriverManager and SimpleChatEngineManager. Both use a driver manager that doesn't auto-start the browser. I'll need to test each part thoroughly.

Starting with SimpleDriverManager. The constructor initializes several attributes like headless, user_data_dir, driver, current_url. Then there's start_browser(), close(), and some logging methods. 

In the tests, I should cover:
1. Initialization: Check if __init__ sets all parameters correctly.
2. Start Browser: Test successful starts with and without headless mode. Also, verify that it doesn't start twice.
3. Close method: Ensure driver is None after close, and that calling close again does nothing.
4. Edge Cases: What happens if user_data_dir doesn't exist? Or if the driver isn't found?
5. Logging: Verify log messages are correct when headless or not.

Now, SimpleChatEngineManager extends the driver manager but adds configuration handling. Tests should check:
1. Initialization with config and base_dir.
2. Configuration keys being correctly set. Maybe test missing values.
3. Proper initialization of the driver manager from chat engine manager.
4. Shutdown method: Make sure driver manager is closed.

External dependencies like Selenium and PathManager need mocking. Since I can't install them, in tests I'll mock their existence or provide stubs for services and executables.

For each test case, I should think about setup (like creating mocks) before writing assertions. Using @pytest.fixture might help create these mocks once per test.

I also need to handle exceptions: Maybe write a test that intentionally causes an error in start_browser() to check error logging.

Edge cases for SimpleDriverManager include no user_data_dir, multiple attempts to start browser, non-existent driver paths. For ChatEngineManager, ensure configuration parsing works correctly with various inputs.

When mocking, I'll need to mock classes like Options, Service, PathManager, and ChromeDriverManager. Using unittest.mock.Mock or patching in pytest would work. For example, if I can't install dependencies, maybe raise a stub service that returns None when asked for executable path.

I should structure each test class with setup before each method under test. Also, include both normal cases and edge cases. Maybe write separate test classes for each manager to keep things organized.

In the end, the tests should cover all major functionalities, ensure proper logging, handle errors gracefully, and validate that external dependencies are mocked correctly so the tests run without actual installations.

Here is a comprehensive test suite for the `SimpleDriverManager` and `SimpleChatEngineManager` classes. The tests include edge cases, mocking of external dependencies, and thorough validation.

### Explanation

The provided test suite includes the following key features:

1. **Setup for External Dependencies**: Mocks are used to replace external dependencies (like `Selenium`, `PathManager`) with stubs or mocks that can be controlled during testing.

2. **Edge Cases Tested**:
   - Driver manager initialized without user_data_dir.
   - Multiple calls to start_browser() checked.
   - Proper handling of non-existent driver paths and configurations.

3. **Logging Tests**: Verifies that the correct log messages are emitted based on different parameters (headless vs not headless).

4. **Configuration Handling**:
   - Tested proper configuration parsing with default values.
   - Tested error cases where configuration keys may be missing or invalid.

5. **Shutdown Method**: Ensures proper cleanup of resources and driver manager instances after shutdown.

6. **DRY Principle**: Reused `SimpleDriverManager` mock across tests to avoid code duplication, leveraging Python's mocking capabilities.

The test cases cover both normal usage scenarios as well as edge cases to ensure the robustness of the codebase.
