    <h1>Dev Blog: Exploring Assembly for Market Data Replay</h1>

    <!-- Introduction Section -->
    <section class="grid-item">
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        In this side project, I dove headfirst into low-level programming with assembly language. The goal? To build a time-optimized engine for replaying historical market data as a way to backtest trading strategies for <a href="#">FreeRide Investor</a>.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- What I Learned Section -->
    <section class="grid-item">
      <h2>What I Learned</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Low-Level System Interaction:</strong> Working directly with the system via Linux syscalls taught me how data is handled at its most basic level.</li>
        <li><strong>Binary Data Processing:</strong> I gained exposure to how structured binary files are read and interpreted in assembly.</li>
        <li><strong>Debugging Mindset:</strong> Debugging segmentation errors helped me appreciate the importance of memory management and error-checking in low-level code.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <!-- Challenges Faced Section -->
    <section class="grid-item">
      <h2>Challenges Faced</h2>
      <p>This was no easy journey. Here are some struggles I encountered:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Understanding segmentation faults and debugging memory access issues.</li>
        <li>Converting binary data (like timestamps and prices) into human-readable formats.</li>
        <li>Working with floating-point numbers in assembly—a complex and error-prone process.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <!-- Where This Fits Section -->
    <section class="grid-item">
      <h2>Where This Fits Into FreeRide Investor</h2>
      <p>
        This project is the first step in building tools for realistic strategy testing. By simulating historical market conditions, traders on the <a href="#">FreeRide Investor</a> platform can validate their approaches in a controlled environment. While this assembly-based replay engine was a learning experience, future iterations will integrate these concepts into higher-level tools.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- What's Next Section -->
    <section class="grid-item">
      <h2>What's Next</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Rebuilding the replay engine in Python for easier integration with other tools.</li>
        <li>Adding more robust error handling and improving buffer management.</li>
        <li>Creating a bridge between this low-level exploration and practical tools for the FreeRide Investor platform.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>
  </main>

Key Changes:
Modernized Background and Text:
Background: Dark gray (#0f0f0f) for the page and slightly lighter (#181818) for the content boxes.
Text: A lighter gray (#dcdcdc) with a clear font hierarchy for readability.
Improved Section Titles:
Heading (h2): Bright green (#1abc9c) with an underline effect for distinction.
Main Title (h1): Larger, center-aligned, and a lighter green (#2ecc71) for emphasis.
Enhanced Boxes:
Rounded Corners: Subtle rounding (10px) for a clean design.
Box Shadows: Slight shadow effect for depth and modern aesthetics.
Responsive Design:
Scales down heading and padding sizes for smaller devices.
Link Styling:
A vibrant blue (#3498db) with a green hover effect (#1abc9c).
This design should feel fresh, professional, and aligned with modern blog styling conventions. Let me know if you’d like further refinements!
