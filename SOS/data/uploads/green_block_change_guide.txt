SYSTEM AUDIT: Victor’s Workflow Analysis (Trading, Automation, Content Generation)
1. Current System Signals (From Chat Context)
Victor is working hands-on with:
Front-end development (PHP, CSS, WordPress theming)
Content delivery systems (blog, discord, twitch integration)
Branding evolution (UI/UX iterations on the site and call-to-actions)
Community engagement (Discord, Twitch)
Manual updates and troubleshooting (CSS tweaks, PHP modifications)
This suggests deep operational involvement in tasks better served by scalable systems and automation.
2. Bottlenecks Identified
⚠️ Manual Front-End Development
Victor is directly managing PHP and CSS edits for minor UI changes (e.g., spacing footer links, adjusting button colors).
Symptoms: Micro-adjustments consume cognitive bandwidth better spent on high-leverage strategy or trading logic refinement.
Root Cause: No low-code CMS or design system in place for rapid UI iterations without code.
⚠️ Redundant QA Cycles
Testing changes by manually refreshing (CTRL+F5) or cache-busting strategies are reactive.
Symptoms: Time wasted debugging UI behaviors or unintended style overrides (e.g., unwanted grey overlay, colors clashing).
Root Cause: Lack of component library documentation, no version-controlled UI kit, and no staging automation.
⚠️ Content Deployment Fragmentation
Twitch, Discord, and the Website operate as isolated nodes rather than a coordinated content funnel.
Symptoms: Manual link updates (e.g., Twitch URL), inconsistent messaging across platforms.
Root Cause: Absence of content syndication automation and API-driven platform orchestration.
3. Redundancies Identified
❌ Manual Social Link Management
Victor is manually updating social URLs in code.
Opportunity: Centralize link management via a CMS options page or global config JSON file, injected dynamically.
❌ Hard-Coded Styles
Inline CSS in PHP templates (style="...") breaks separation of concerns, slowing
