System Audit: Workflow Bottlenecks & Optimization Recommendations
Auditor: System AI
Subject: Victor Dixon
Focus: Trading | Automation | Content Generation
I. Observed Workflow Patterns
1. Trading
Manual MFA Handling:
Robinhood integration currently requires manual intervention (SMS/MFA code input). This interrupts flow, breaks automation, and exposes a key friction point during execution windows.
Redundant Checks in Login Logic:
Repeated login attempts and condition handling in _login() show overlapping logic. No automated retry system or fallback handler is implemented yet.
Execution Pipeline Lacks Pre-Trade Conditions Automation:
Trade setup confirmations (volume, MACD curls, RSI triggers) are done manually or implied but not fully systematized into a decision-making automation layer.
2. Automation
Redundant Format Creation:
Posts are being manually tailored for Discord, Facebook, LinkedIn, and Stocktwits. Each version requires platform-specific adjustmentsâ€”this is repetitive, draining time and cognitive resources.
HTML and Content Publishing Is Manual:
HTML formatting and linking are crafted by hand. There's no template system or automated publishing pipeline integrated with the CMS or social channels.
Lack of Unified Task Tracking
Task switching between bot dev, content writing, and trading strategy lacks a centralized priority system. This creates mental friction and lowers execution clarity.
3. Content Generation
Voice Alignment Done Iteratively Instead of Systemically:
Matching tone and voice across posts is being refined individually. No voice prompt templates or persona-guided frameworks are consistently applied yet.
Technical Analysis Dissemination Still Manual:
While analysis (RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands, etc.) is consistent, report generation is manual rather than programmatically pulled from data sources and output as ready-to-post insights.
II. Bottlenecks, Redundancies, Inefficiencies
Issue Impact Consequence
Manual MFA Handling Critical Breaks flow; delays execution in time-sensitive trades
Redundant Multi-Platform Content Creation High Wastes time and focus; prevents scaling
Manual Technical Analysis Reporting High Slows decision-making; drains creative/analytical energy
Dispersed Task Management Medium Context switching; task collisions; no velocity compounding
No Template Engine for Content Publishing Medium Slows content production and delivery
Redundant Logic in API Login & Fail Handling Medium Introduces unnecessary complexity; harder to debug
III. High-Impact Optimizations
1. Automate MFA and Session Persistence
Objective: Eliminate manual MFA interruptions.
Solution:
Implement persistent session tokens or store auth credentials securely to avoid daily re-logins.
If Robinhood blocks full automation, explore brokerage API alternatives with full automation capabilities (IBKR, Alpaca for futures/synthetics).
Alternatively, consider simulating user input through headless browser automation (Playwright/Selenium) only for MFA step.
2. Build a Modular Content Template Engine
Objective: Automate multi-platform content adaptation.
Solution:
Create a Jinja2/Handlebars template engine that generates posts for Discord, LinkedIn, Facebook, Stocktwits based on one source draft.
Feed platform-specific prompts into ChatGPT to output the same strategy in each voice/tone.
Automate HTML block creation for your site posts.
3. Systematize Technical Analysis Reports
Objective: Remove manual effort from reporting and increase decision velocity.
Solution:
Build an automated report generator pulling data (RSI, MACD, Bollinger, Volume, QQQ correlations) from a data feed (Alpaca, TradingView API).
Output pre-formatted reports in Markdown/HTML for instant publishing or Discord posting.
Integrate confirmation triggers into trade setup logic for AI-based entry/exit signals.
4. Consolidate Workflow & Task Management
Objective: Streamline execution and eliminate context switching.
Solution:
Deploy Notion or Obsidian with Dataview as the centralized task hub.
Implement daily/weekly sprint planning focused on trading, content, automation.
Use AI task prioritization to optimize what gets done based on system bottlenecks.
5. Refactor API Login Logic
Objective: Simplify and harden authentication flow.
Solution:
Wrap login and MFA handling in a retry decorator with exponential backoff.
Simplify response handling to reduce code branches and errors.
IV. Priority Actions for Maximum Velocity
Priority Action Outcome
1 Automate MFA handling or switch to broker API with full access Restore uninterrupted bot execution flow
2 Build content generation template system (Jinja2 + AI prompts) Slash content creation time by 70%
3 Automate TA report generation and integrate into trade logic Speed up decision-making; eliminate manual prep
4 Centralize task/project management in Notion or Obsidian Increase focus, remove task switching drain
5 Refactor TradingAPI login logic with retries and simplification Reduce errors, increase reliability
Conclusion
Your system is close to convergence, but key friction points are bleeding time, focus, and momentum. Eliminate manual bottlenecks, systematize outputs, and consolidate your workflows. This will unlock automation synergy, increase execution velocity, and enable self-reinforcing growth cycles.
When systems move in sync, speed becomes inevitable.
