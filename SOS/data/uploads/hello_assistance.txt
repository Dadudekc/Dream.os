System Audit: Workflow Bottlenecks, Redundancies, and Inefficiencies
Victor's Domains: Trading, Automation, Content Generation
Objective: Accelerate convergence, eliminate drag, and unlock system-wide execution velocity.
1. Current State Analysis
A. Development Workflow (TBOWTactics)
Inefficiencies Identified:
Over-reliance on SwiftUI and Combine in CLI Contexts
You're working in a command-line environment, yet a large portion of your architecture assumes SwiftUI and Combine dependencies.
This creates compiler issues (no such module) and prevents execution, slowing testing and feedback loops.
Duplicate Definitions and File Redundancy
Multiple definitions (e.g., HistoricalStockData) across files cause ambiguity and compilation errors.
Redundant model declarations between files (e.g., NetworkManager.swift and StockData.swift) inflate complexity and cognitive load.
XCTest and UI Tests Included in CLI Builds
Including test files (StockResearchViewUITests.swift) in CLI builds leads to unnecessary compilation failures.
Unit/UI testing frameworks are not functional in your current CLI context, yet they remain entangled in build processes.
Energy Dilution:
Time spent troubleshooting Combine and SwiftUI module errors.
Repeated manual builds (swiftc runs) with unresolved structural inefficiencies.
Emotional energy diverted toward toolchain obstacles rather than high-leverage strategy.
B. Automation & AI Integration
Inefficiencies Identified:
AI Service (OpenAI) Bound to Asynchronous Combine Pipelines
Combine-based networking prevents synchronous CLI testing, slowing feedback cycles.
AI-generated insights (e.g., trade plans) are not yet integrated into a decision support system that feeds automated action pipelines.
Manual Data Input and Command-Driven Execution
Repeated manual data entry for stock symbols rather than batch processing or automated scanning.
No persistent state management between runs (no cache reuse, session awareness, or stateful agent).
Energy Dilution:
Execution trapped in a human-triggered loop.
AI tools output data, but there's a gap in automating the decision-action loop in trading.
C. Content Generation
Inefficiencies Identified:
No Clear Bridge Between Codebase Progress and Content Production
Progress, breakthroughs, and learning are buried in logs/chats instead of being channeled into content pipelines.
Content generation (for devlogs or documentation) isn't automated from version control or commit history.
Duplication of Mental Models
You are mentally toggling between system building, AI agent reasoning, and content framing without clear cognitive delegation.
Energy Dilution:
Friction in context-switching slows ideation and execution.
Lack of automated content triggers from system events or milestones (e.g., "AI-generated trade plan #23 complete: send to devlog queue").
2. Root Causes
Problem Root Cause
CLI build issues UI-centric architecture interwoven with CLI core logic
Redundant data models Lack of strict domain segregation and shared data contracts
Slow AI-human interaction No automated analysis â†’ decision â†’ execution loop
Content-production bottleneck No systemized capture of insights and automated publishing
3. Immediate, High-Impact Optimizations
A. Architectural Refactoring
Segregate CLI Core from UI/Combine Code
Create a /Core directory exclusively for CLI-safe, UI-free logic. This becomes your systemâ€™s universal data engine.
Modularize Data Models with Clear Ownership
One canonical definition per model type. Implement SharedModels.swift for core data entities (e.g., HistoricalStockData, StockPrediction).
B. Replace Combine with Callbacks in CLI Core
Refactor services to use simple completion handlers for CLI builds.
Reserve Combine and SwiftUI for optional UI builds, behind feature flags or different targets.
C. Automate the AI Decision Loop
Implement a daemon (CLI agent or Python script) that:
Pulls stock data on a schedule.
Triggers AI analysis (predictions, trade plans).
Evaluates confidence thresholds and writes actionable outputs to a queue (alerts, trading bots).
D. Content Generation Pipeline
Auto-generate daily devlog drafts from:
Commit history.
AI trading insights.
System execution logs (e.g., "Trade Plan Generated: XYZ").
Route these drafts into Notion/Markdown files for final polish.
4. Priority Action Plan: Maximum Velocity Execution
# Action Impact Timeline
1 Refactor core logic into CLI-safe module ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ 1 day
2 Purge redundant models, centralize in Core ðŸš€ðŸš€ 0.5 day
3 Remove Combine & SwiftUI dependencies ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ 1 day
4 Implement AI insights â†’ decision â†’ action loop ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ 2 days
5 Automate devlog drafts from system outputs ðŸš€ðŸš€ 1 day
6 Remove XCTest & UI tests from CLI build scope ðŸš€ 0.5 day
5. Conclusion: Accelerating System Convergence
Victor, the bottlenecks lie in a legacy UI-first architecture clashing with your current CLI-driven execution context. The system is ready to evolve into an AI-powered agentâ€”autonomous, reflexive, and self-organizing. Strip the friction. Reinforce modularity. Automate decisions.
Your focus: Build the command-line core that thinks, acts, and documents itself.
Once this is live, content and trade execution flows from itâ€”without you in the loop.
Final Thought
"The future belongs to the system that executes itselfâ€”your role is to teach it to think."
Ready to implement the priority actions?
Q1: Would you like a base project structure for Core/UI segregation?
Q2: Should we scaffold the AI â†’ action daemon first?
Q3: Do you prefer a lightweight CLI for manual overrides or an autonomous agent model?
