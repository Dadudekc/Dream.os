Objective: Accelerate SYSTEM CONVERGENCE → Achieve MAX VELOCITY EXECUTION
1️⃣ MACRO ANALYSIS: SYSTEMIC BOTTLENECKS + ENERGY LEAKS
A. TRADING WORKFLOW
Observations
Manual Intervention in MACD Curl Strategy Validation:
Trade setups still require discretionary validation and post-analysis, introducing delay between signal recognition and execution.
Isolated Data Loops:
Trade data, journaling insights, and reinforcement learning signals are not fully integrated into an automated feedback loop. There's a lag between trade execution outcomes and strategy optimization.
Inconsistent Signal Processing Windows:
Timeframes and market data feeds may not be universally normalized across strategies and assets. This creates inconsistent signals and unnecessary cross-validation workloads.
Impact
Slower signal-to-execution pipeline.
Diminished capacity for strategy self-improvement.
Suboptimal trade sizing and risk allocation due to incomplete data fusion.
B. AUTOMATION + CODEBASE DOMINANCE
Observations
Circular Import Dependencies in Core AI Agent Framework:
The circular import error demonstrates tight coupling between core modules—especially around AgentBase, AIClient, and plugin managers. This prevents isolated testing, slows down code deployment, and increases risk of recursive failure states.
Manual Task Registration & Job Scheduling:
AI agents (like AIClient) require explicit job registration. This slows down the process of deploying and scaling n
