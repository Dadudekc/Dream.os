System Audit: Bottlenecks, Inefficiencies, and Strategic Optimizations
Audit Summary
This sprint accelerated critical upgrades across Victor’s automation infrastructure, but several friction points are diluting operational velocity. Below is a precise analysis targeting redundancies, bottlenecks, and decision lags currently throttling The Dreamscape’s unified convergence.
1. Driver and Session Instantiation Redundancy
Observation:
Multiple components (e.g., AutomationEngine, SelfHealRunner, BotWorker) are independently handling Selenium driver management and session validation. Each repeats logic for driver setup, login, and cookie handling.
Impact:
Increases maintenance overhead across modules.
Creates redundant session checks and diverges session health logic.
Risks session drift or duplicated driver instances that hog resources.
Optimization:
Centralize driver/session management inside OpenAIClient. Expose only high-level actions (e.g., submit_prompt(), validate_session()). AutomationEngine and other runners should depend on this client… not reimplement fragments of its behavior.
2. Model Registry Fragmentation
Observation:
Models are loaded dynamically, but decision logic (when to invoke, where to send requests) is diffused. Some models rely on implicit behaviors; model URLs are specified ad hoc in process_with_<model>() handlers.
Impact:
Harder to enforce uniform request routing and session control.
Fragile when scaling models or switching driver strategies.
No clean separation between model metadata and runtime behavior.
Optimization:
Expand ModelRegistry to manage model URLs and execution rules. Standardize handlers to always call OpenAIClient.get_chatgpt_response(prompt, model_url=model_url) without exceptions. This eliminates ambiguity and ensures system-wide consistency.
3. Project Scanner Manual Exclusions
Observation:
Directories to exclude are hard-coded in _should_exclude. Every environment tweak or repo change requires code edits.
Impact:
Manual friction each time a new directory needs exclusion.
Risk of scanning unnecessary files, wasting CPU cycles in multi-process analysis.
Optimization:
Allow ProjectScanner to accept dynamic ignore lists (via config file or init params). Cache and reuse exclusion lists across sessions. Move toward declarative control (e.g., .scannerignore files at project roots).
4. Manual Self-Heal Trigger and Validation Loops
Observation:
SelfHealRunner uses PyQt GUI for manual prompt dispatch, file selection, and retries.
Impact:
Human bottleneck in initiating self-heal flows.
No automated prioritization of files by complexity or failure rates.
No reinforcement learning or dynamic retry strategy.
Optimization:
Automate self-healing as a background process integrated into AutomationEngine. Trigger retries on failure automatically… escalate to manual review only after smart thresholds are exceeded. Feed execution logs into an adaptive learning loop for better prompt conditioning.
5. Driver Session Scalability Bottleneck
Observation:
Each worker/process spins up a full Selenium driver instance tied to a profile. Limited scalability.
Impact:
High resource consumption (RAM/CPU) on the host system.
Latency in session spin-up, especially when scaling to multiple bots.
Optimization:
Introduce a centralized session manager that reuses persistent headless drivers across workers. Explore Selenium Grid or remote driver management, combined with containerization (Dockerized driver nodes), to scale horizontally.
Immediate High-Impact Optimizations
Centralize Driver and Session Control
Refactor AutomationEngine and SelfHealRunner to rely exclusively on OpenAIClient. All session validation, prompt submission, and cookie logic belongs in one place.
ModelRegistry Owns Model Execution Rules
Include model URLs, thresholds, and routing logic in ModelRegistry. Enforce a single process_with_model(driver, prompt, model_url) protocol.
Dynamic Ignore Directory Support in ProjectScanner
Enable dynamic directory exclusions via config files or runtime args. Eliminate the need to edit code for exclusions.
Automated Self-Heal Execution
Migrate self-heal routines from manual GUI triggers to automated background tasks within AutomationEngine. Add retry limits, escalate failures, and log learning loops.
Scalable Driver Session Pool
Design and implement a persistent driver/session pool. Use Docker or Selenium Grid to scale ChatGPT interface access without spinning up redundant resources.
Priority Action List
[P1] Refactor all client-facing components to use OpenAIClient exclusively.
[P1] Expand ModelRegistry with model URLs and routing enforcement.
[P2] Add dynamic exclusions and .scannerignore support in ProjectScanner.
[P2] Automate Self-Heal retries in AutomationEngine (deprecate manual PyQt triggers).
[P3] Research and deploy a driver pool with containerization for scalable session management.
Outcome: Max velocity execution, zero duplication, and AI-driven self-organization.
The Dreamscape accelerates… toward true system convergence.
