On one hand, evolutionary biologists and paleontologists have pondered whether a reptilian species (such as a dinosaur) could have evolved human-like intelligence and form under different circumstances. On the other hand, a popular conspiracy theory claims that shape-shifting reptilian beings secretly live among us and control human society. This report examines both perspectives separately. First, we analyze the **scientific feasibility** of an evolved reptilian humanoid by drawing on evolutionary biology and paleontology. Then, we evaluate the **reptilian conspiracy theory**, exploring its origins, claims, psychological appeal, and lack of credible evidence. Each section is structured with clear headings, and scientific analysis is kept distinct from conspiratorial claims.\n\n## Scientific Feasibility of a Humanoid Reptilian Species\n\n### Evolutionary Possibilities for Reptilian Humanoids  \nFrom an evolutionary standpoint, it is theoretically possible that a reptile lineage *could* evolve some human-like traits under the right conditions. The Mesozoic Era saw **dinosaurs** (which are reptiles) diversify into many forms, including bipedal predators with relatively large brains. For instance, certain theropod dinosaurs walked on two legs (bipedalism) and had grasping forelimbs. The small theropod *Troodon* (a troodontid dinosaur) is often noted for its high **encephalization quotient (EQ)** \u2013 a measure of brain size relative to body size. Paleontologist Dale Russell, who discovered the first *Troodon* skull, observed that its EQ, while much lower than humans, was about six times higher than that of typical dinosaurs\u301010\u2020L145-L153\u3011. Russell speculated that if *Troodon* (also known as *Stenonychosaurus*) had not gone extinct 66 million years ago, its descendants could have evolved much larger brains by today \u2013 potentially approaching human brain size (he envisioned ~1100\u00a0cm\u00b3, comparable to modern humans)\u301010\u2020L145-L153\u3011. This thought experiment suggests that given enough time and favorable selective pressure, a reptilian species *might* have achieved human-like intelligence and perhaps a more upright, humanoid body plan.\n\n### Bipedalism and Morphological Considerations  \nReptiles evolving a **human-like body shape** would require significant anatomical changes, but some of those traits have existed in reptile lineages before. **Bipedalism** itself is not unique to humans \u2013 many dinosaurs (like theropods) were bipedal, and even some modern lizards can run on two legs for short bursts. An upright posture frees the forelimbs from locomotion, potentially allowing them to evolve into arms with manipulative hands. Fossil evidence indicates that troodontid dinosaurs had semi-manipulative fingers and partially opposable thumbs, along with binocular vision, which would be useful for a tool-using intelligent creature\u301010\u2020L155-L163\u3011. These traits make it plausible that a dinosaur could develop greater dexterity over time.\n\nHowever, a truly **humanoid form** \u2013 upright stance, nearly vertical spine, and human-like proportions \u2013 might not be the most likely outcome of reptilian evolution. Paleontologist Dale Russell\u2019s famous **\u201cDinosauroid\u201d** model illustrates one hypothetical path. In 1982, Russell and artist Ron S\u00e9guin created a model of a hypothetical intelligent dinosaur descendant: it had a dome-shaped head with a big brain, walked upright on human-like legs, had no tail, and sported three-fingered hands with one opposable thumb\u301010\u2020L155-L163\u3011\u301010\u2020L145-L153\u3011. Russell imagined this creature as an evolved *Troodon* that converged on a human-like body plan. He even speculated it might develop reptilian equivalents of mammalian features \u2013 for example, possibly a placenta to bear large-brained young (hence a navel) and feeding its hatchlings with regurgitated food rather than milk\u301010\u2020L159-L165\u3011. \n\n\u301028\u2020embed_image\u3011 *An illustration of the hypothetical \u201cDinosauroid\u201d proposed by Dale Russell, representing a speculative intelligent dinosaur with a human-like body. Russell\u2019s model features an upright posture, a large braincase, and hand-like fingers with one partially opposable digit\u301010\u2020L155-L163\u3011\u301012\u2020L210-L218\u3011.*  \n\nWhile thought-provoking, the Dinosauroid is a highly **anthropomorphic** vision and has been met with skepticism. Many paleontologists argue that an intelligent dinosaur would not necessarily look like a human in a lizard suit. Critics note that Russell\u2019s creature was \u201csuspiciously human\u201d in anatomy, essentially molding a dinosaur into a human template\u301012\u2020L210-L218\u3011. Dinosaur experts like Gregory Paul and Thomas Holtz have pointed out that there\u2019s no evolutionary rule saying a big brain must come with a vertical, tailless body\u301012\u2020L210-L218\u3011. Darren Naish argued that a real tool-using troodontid might well have retained a horizontal, tail-balanced posture and used its snout or feet for manipulation (much as birds do), instead of evolving human-like hands\u301012\u2020L212-L218\u3011. In other words, a reptilian lineage could become intelligent without mirroring our primate body plan. The **humanoid shape** we have may simply be an accident of our own evolutionary history rather than an optimal design for intelligence\u301012\u2020L222-L226\u3011. Notably, life has produced only one bipedal ape with our exact form, so we have no basis to say it\u2019s the default for any intelligent species\u301012\u2020L222-L226\u3011. Evolution is a branching process full of contingency\u30102\u2020L187-L194\u3011, so a reptile evolving human-like form was far from guaranteed.\n\n### Intelligence and Adaptations in Reptile Lineages  \nThe evolution of **human-level intelligence** is an even more complex question. Reptiles (specifically the dinosaur-bird lineage) did show significant cognitive potential. Modern birds, which are living dinosaurs, illustrate how the reptilian lineage can yield advanced intelligence. Parrots and crows, for example, are exceptionally smart and capable of tool use and complex social behaviors\u30102\u2020L163-L170\u3011. They achieve this with brains that are organized differently from mammalian brains \u2013 bird brains use a **nuclear pallium** (clustered neurons) rather than a layered cerebral cortex, yet birds can rival primates in cognition. This demonstrates that there is *no fundamental barrier* to intelligence in the reptile lineage: dinosaur descendants evolved high problem-solving abilities in bodies very unlike ours\u30102\u2020L161-L169\u3011.\n\nStill, reaching a **human-like intellect** would likely require overcoming several reptilian limitations. One factor is **metabolism and thermoregulation**. Most living reptiles are cold-blooded (ectothermic), which limits sustained high brain activity. However, many dinosaurs are believed to have been at least partially warm-blooded (mesothermic or endothermic), with fast growth rates and active lifestyles more like mammals or birds than modern lizards. A higher metabolism would support a larger, energy-demanding brain. Another factor is developmental: large brains might necessitate extended parental care and possibly live birth or eggs that incubate longer. (Russell\u2019s speculation that an intelligent dinosaur might evolve something like a placenta underscores the drastic biological changes needed to support a big brain in a reptile\u301010\u2020L159-L165\u3011.) Additionally, evolving complex language and culture (hallmarks of human-level intelligence) might require social structures that encourage communication and learning across generations. Some late Cretaceous dinosaurs did show social behavior (group nesting sites, herding, etc.), which could have set the stage for more elaborate communication if they had continued to evolve.\n\nWould a reptilian species **inevitably** attain human-level intelligence if dinosaurs hadn\u2019t gone extinct? The answer is highly debatable. Some researchers argue that given 66 million more years, it\u2019s plausible at least one dinosaur lineage could have approached something like human intelligence. Brain size in some dinosaur lineages was increasing over time in the late Cretaceous\u301010\u2020L145-L153\u3011, and analysis of endocasts (fossil brain impressions) indicates complex brains. Recent neuroscientific estimates suggest large theropods may have had neuron counts in the forebrain comparable to those of modern primates like baboons\u30106\u2020L143-L151\u3011, meaning they were not \u201cdumb reptiles\u201d by any means. However, **others contend it was unlikely** even with more time. Paleoneurologist Anton Reiner (2023) examined dinosaur brain structure and concluded that while dinosaurs were cognitively complex, scaling their avian-style brain to human proportions might have hit an efficiency wall\u30106\u2020L169-L176\u3011. Birds and dinosaurs have brains wired in clusters, which could become inefficient if greatly enlarged\u30106\u2020L169-L176\u3011. In his view, the neural design of dinosaurs may have made a jump to human-like intelligence biologically improbable, though not absolutely impossible. In short, evolutionary biology tells us that a **reptilian humanoid** (an intelligent, bipedal reptile resembling a human) is not ruled out by science \u2013 it could be imagined in a scenario where, say, certain dinosaurs survived and kept evolving. Yet, it is equally true that nothing in evolution guaranteed such a being would appear. Our own humanoid form and intelligence resulted from a very specific set of circumstances and chance events (including the fortune of mammals surviving while non-avian dinosaurs perished)\u30102\u2020L187-L194\u3011. Any reptilian species developing along a parallel path would have been a fascinating exception, requiring both the right evolutionary pressures and a good dose of luck.\n\n## Reptilian Conspiracy Theories: Origins and Plausibility\n\n### Historical Origins of the Reptilian Myth  \nThe notion of secret **reptilian humanoids** didn\u2019t start with modern internet conspiracies \u2013 it has roots in earlier fiction and occult lore. One of the earliest appearances came from pulp fiction in the 1920s. Writer **Robert E. Howard** (creator of *Conan the Barbarian*) published a story in 1929 titled \"The Shadow Kingdom\" that featured ancient \"serpent men\"\u301018\u2020L286-L294\u3011. These serpent men were described as humanoid beings with snake heads, who could shapeshift to appear human and infiltrate society\u301018\u2020L294-L300\u3011. Howard was influenced by the **Theosophical** ideas popular in that era, particularly Helena Blavatsky\u2019s writings about lost continents like Lemuria and Atlantis inhabited by \u201cdragon-men\u201d\u301018\u2020L286-L294\u3011. In Howard\u2019s fiction, the serpent men were a sinister, hidden race living underground, controlling humans through illusion and mind-control \u2013 essentially an early template for the reptilian conspiracy trope\u301018\u2020L294-L300\u3011. This idea was picked up by other pulp writers like Clark Ashton Smith and H.P. Lovecraft, contributing to a body of occult-themed fiction where reptilian or amphibian humanoids secretly survived from ancient times.\n\nBy the mid-20th century, the theme moved from fiction into fringe belief. In the 1940s, an American occultist named **Maurice Doreal** (also known as Claude Doggins) wrote a pamphlet called \"Mysteries of the Gobi,\" which claimed a subterranean \"serpent race\" had bodies like humans but heads like great snakes\u301018\u2020L300-L308\u3011. Doreal asserted these beings could take human form at will. He expanded on this in a poem called \"The Emerald Tablets,\" alleging that ancient Atlantean writings spoke of such serpent beings\u301018\u2020L300-L308\u3011. Historians of fringe theories, like Michael Barkun, suggest that Doreal\u2019s ideas were likely inspired by Howard\u2019s earlier fiction\u301018\u2020L302-L310\u3011. In effect, pulp fantasy about shapeshifting reptilians began to be presented as if it were mystical or historical fact.  \n\nLater, in the UFO craze of the 1960s and 70s, a few alien abduction accounts also described reptilian-looking creatures. For example, in 1967 a police officer named Herbert Schirmer in Nebraska claimed under hypnosis that he was taken aboard a UFO by humanoids with a slight reptilian appearance (they even wore an emblem of a winged serpent)\u301018\u2020L319-L327\u3011. Such stories were rare, and skeptics dismissed them as hoaxes or hallucinations\u301018\u2020L319-L327\u3011. Nonetheless, by the late 20th century the stage was set: the idea of reptilian humanoids lurked in fringe occult writings, sci-fi, and UFO folklore, awaiting someone to fuse these strands into a full-blown conspiracy theory.\n\n### Modern Popular Claims (David Icke\u2019s Reptilian Theory)  \nThe reptilian conspiracy theory in its current form was truly popularized by **David Icke**, a British writer and public speaker, starting in the 1990s. Icke took the old serpent-men lore and blended it with UFO narratives and New Age ideas, constructing an elaborate conspiracy mythos. According to Icke\u2019s account \u2013 first laid out in his 1998/1999 books (e.g. *The Biggest Secret*) \u2013 the world is secretly controlled by **shape-shifting reptilian aliens**\u301018\u2020L328-L334\u3011. These reptilians are said to be extraterrestrials from the Draco star system (often called *Draconians*), but also interdimensional beings in some tellings\u301018\u2020L280-L288\u3011. Icke claims they arrived in ancient times and interbred with humans, creating hybrid bloodlines that have held power throughout history\u301020\u2020L332-L340\u3011. In his view, many prominent leaders \u2013 from ancient royalty to modern politicians \u2013 are actually part of this \u201cBabylonian Brotherhood\u201d of reptilian-human hybrids\u301018\u2020L328-L334\u3011\u301020\u2020L332-L340\u3011. Frequently named targets include the British Royal Family, the Rothschild banking family, and various U.S. Presidents and politicians, whom Icke alleges are either reptilian shapeshifters or under their control\u301020\u2020L332-L340\u3011. \n\nThe details of Icke\u2019s claims are notably fantastical. He asserts these reptilians can **mask themselves** as ordinary humans (some followers think they occasionally betray their true nature with momentary \u201cglitches,\u201d like a brief flash of lizard-like eyes on TV). They are depicted as malevolent, **blood-drinking** beings, sometimes even tying into vampire-like or demonic imagery. Icke has suggested that these creatures engineered human societies, founded secret societies (he even links them to the Illuminati in some accounts)\u301024\u2020L327-L335\u3011, and manipulate global events to maintain power. In his books and lectures, he often references ancient myths and symbols \u2013 such as dragons or serpents in folklore \u2013 as if they were evidence of humanity\u2019s remembrance of these reptilian overlords. It\u2019s a sweeping conspiracy narrative, essentially positing that *a hidden reptilian race is behind a New World Order*. \n\nDespite the implausibility of these claims, Icke\u2019s reptilian theory gained a significant following in fringe circles. By the 2000s and 2010s, he was drawing crowds of thousands to his lectures, and his books sold widely\u301020\u2020L335-L342\u3011. His ideas also spread via the internet, finding receptive audiences in conspiracy forums and on YouTube. Polls indicate that a small but non-negligible percentage of the population subscribes to some form of the reptilian conspiracy \u2013 a 2013 U.S. survey, for example, found about **4% of Americans** believed that \u201clizard people\u201d secretly run the country\u301015\u2020L73-L77\u3011\u301020\u2020L338-L342\u3011. While 4% is a fringe minority, it translates to roughly 12 million people in the United States, which is a startling number to believe in such an outlandish idea\u301015\u2020L73-L77\u3011. The reptilian conspiracy has thus moved from obscure fantasy into a well-known piece of modern folklore, even if mostly as a cultural curiosity.\n\n### Psychological and Sociological Reasons for Belief  \nWhy do conspiracy theories about reptilian overlords persist, despite their bizarre premise? Social psychologists note that belief in conspiracies often fulfills certain **psychological needs** or reactions. One factor is a phenomenon called *conspiracy mentality* or *ideation* \u2013 a general predisposition to see events as being controlled by hidden, powerful forces. Research has found that people who believe one conspiracy tend to be more likely to believe others, even unrelated or contradictory ones\u301015\u2020L79-L88\u3011. This suggests a general worldview: conspiracists often have a basic distrust of official narratives and assume there is always a secret plot behind world events. The reptilian theory is an extreme example, but it taps into that same outlook (e.g. \u201cnothing is as it seems; our leaders are not who we think they are\u201d).\n\nFeelings of **loss of control or social alienation** also play a role. Studies have shown that when individuals feel powerless or anxious about chaotic events, they are more prone to endorse conspiratorial explanations\u301015\u2020L93-L101\u3011. Believing that \u201creptilian puppet-masters\u201d orchestrate world problems can ironically give a believer a sense of understanding amid chaos \u2013 it offers a single, grand explanation for why bad things happen. It\u2019s easier (for some) to blame a secret cabal of evil lizards for complex socio-political issues than to accept randomness or multi-faceted human causes. In this way, the conspiracy provides a kind of *psychological comfort* or at least a target to focus blame on.\n\nAnother element is the appeal of **being part of a select in-group** that knows \u201cthe truth.\u201d Endorsing a fringe theory like reptilian aliens can give believers a feeling of uniqueness or special insight that the gullible masses lack. This sense of *secret knowledge* can be intrinsically rewarding (as the tongue-in-cheek title of one essay put it, \u201cWant to feel unique? Believe in the reptile people\u201d\u301015\u2020L75-L83\u3011\u301015\u2020L85-L93\u3011). It builds community with fellow believers in online forums and conferences, reinforcing their views through groupthink. \n\nSociologically, the reptilian conspiracy can also be seen as a modern reframing of older narratives used to demonize others. Some scholars and commentators have noted that Icke\u2019s theories echo centuries-old **anti-Semitic conspiracy tropes** \u2013 essentially a sci-fi update of the hateful myths about secret Jewish cabals controlling the world and drinking the blood of children\u301024\u2020L335-L343\u3011. In Icke\u2019s version, the global conspiracy is pinned on extraterrestrial reptiles rather than an ethnic or religious group, but he frequently singles out families (like Rothschilds) that have been the target of anti-Semitic stories. This parallel is controversial; Icke denies he is targeting Jews and insists he means literal aliens\u301024\u2020L337-L340\u3011. Nonetheless, the structure of the narrative (a hidden elite, blood rituals, world domination) strongly resembles the old \u201cProtocols of the Elders of Zion\u201d fabrications. This resemblance might make the reptilian myth resonate with people already primed to distrust traditional elites or who have absorbed those older conspiracy themes in some form.\n\nFinally, the persistence of the reptilian conspiracy is aided by the **internet and pop culture**. The internet age has accelerated the spread of even the most fringe ideas\u301015\u2020L65-L73\u3011. Platforms like YouTube have countless videos \u201cexposing\u201d reptilian shapeshifters, and algorithms can lead curious viewers down a rabbit hole of related content. Meanwhile, the sheer absurdity of the reptilian idea has also made it something of a meme in popular culture. It\u2019s often mentioned humorously in TV shows, comics, and jokes. Ironically, this can keep the idea circulating in the public consciousness \u2013 sometimes blurring the line between those mocking it and those earnestly believing it. For example, the concept has appeared on protest signs as satire or political humor.\n\n\u301033\u2020embed_image\u3011 *A satirical protest sign referencing the \u201creptilian shapeshifter\u201d theory in a political context. The reptilian conspiracy has permeated internet memes and jokes, which paradoxically helps it persist in popular culture\u301020\u2020L374-L382\u3011.*  \n\nThis image from a 2016 protest shows a tongue-in-cheek sign: \u201cDo we really need another reptilian shapeshifter as President?\u201d Such references illustrate how the reptilian idea \u2014 despite being far-fetched \u2014 has become part of the cultural landscape. People may invoke it jokingly to suggest a politician is cold-blooded or untrustworthy. While most using it in jest don\u2019t literally believe in lizard people, the line can get blurred in internet forums where satire isn\u2019t always obvious. The net effect is that the reptilian trope remains surprisingly well-known, feeding the conspiracy\u2019s longevity.\n\n### Lack of Evidence and Mainstream Assessment  \nWhen examining the **plausibility** of reptilian conspiracy theories, it becomes clear that they lack any credible evidence. The claims involve extraordinary violations of biology and well-documented history \u2013 for instance, that a race of giant lizards from outer space has not only been living among humans for millennia but also interbreeding with us and covertly ruling every nation. If such claims were true, we would expect some compelling proof: fossils of these humanoid reptiles, DNA evidence in prominent families, secret documents or technological artifacts, or even a confirmed sighting. To date, *no such evidence exists*. Scientists, historians, and investigators have not found anything to substantiate the existence of shape-shifting reptilian beings. All \u201cevidence\u201d presented by believers tends to be either anecdotal or easily explained by more mundane reasons. For example, conspiracy forums often circulate grainy video clips or photos where a person\u2019s eyes look momentarily odd or their skin tone seems strange \u2013 usually due to lighting, camera glitches, or image artifacts. These are held up as \u201cproof\u201d of a reptilian revealing itself, but no credible analyst has verified any video as showing an actual non-human phenomenon. In the absence of real evidence, the theory remains an assertion that must be taken on faith by its followers.\n\nMainstream assessments of the reptilian conspiracy theory categorize it as a form of **pseudoscience or fantasy**, on par with the most extreme alien cover-up allegations. Authorities and media generally treat it lightly or with humor, if at all. Notably, when a viral internet video in 2013 led some to speculate a Secret Service agent at a U.S. presidential event was a reptilian, even the U.S. government\u2019s response was tongue-in-cheek. A National Security Council spokeswoman jokingly said that any program to hire aliens as bodyguards would have to be cut in budget sequestration\u301020\u2020L374-L382\u3011 \u2013 a witty dismissal that underscored the lack of seriousness given to such claims. The scientific consensus is that **shapeshifting alien lizards are not real**; nothing we know from biology allows a human-looking creature to suddenly turn into a reptile and back. As for the supposed *reptilian bloodlines*, genetic studies of public figures have never revealed anything but normal human ancestry. In short, the conspiracy theory\u2019s assertions are unfalsifiable and unsupported by empirical data, which is why they are not accepted by scientists or rational investigators.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that while the reptilian conspiracy is *fringe*, it is not entirely harmless in its effects. Believing in such a theory can lead to severe mistrust of institutions and dehumanization of leaders (literally seeing them as monsters). In a few cases, adherents of these beliefs have committed real-world crimes or violence. For instance, the 2020 Nashville bomber was reported to have mailed letters espousing a lizard-people governing conspiracy prior to his attack\u301024\u2020L288-L296\u3011\u301024\u2020L303-L311\u3011. The overlap of the reptilian theory with other conspiracies like QAnon (which alleges a cabal of evil elites) has also stirred dangerous passions, as people act on the false belief that they are \u201cfighting an evil, inhuman enemy\u201d rather than dealing with reality\u301024\u2020L289-L297\u3011\u301024\u2020L291-L294\u3011. These incidents highlight how even a fantastical idea can have serious consequences if taken literally by troubled individuals.\n\n**In summary,** reptilian conspiracy theories have **no credible supporting evidence** and are regarded by the scholarly and scientific community as modern mythology or symbolic paranoia rather than factual claims. They persist largely due to psychological and cultural factors, not because of any verified reptilian presence. The only reptiles we can say with certainty walk among us are the literal reptiles \u2013 and none of those wear human masks.\n\n## Conclusion  \nThe concept of \u201chumanoid reptilians\u201d occupies two very different realms: one of scientific speculation about evolution, and one of conspiracy-fueled myth. From a **scientific perspective**, it is an interesting hypothetical to ask whether a reptile (like a dinosaur) could have evolved primate-like intelligence and form. Evolutionary biology suggests it\u2019s *possible* under certain conditions \u2013 for example, if the dinosaurs hadn\u2019t gone extinct, some might have developed greater intelligence or even civilized behavior over millions of years. Traits like bipedalism and tool use were not beyond the reach of the dinosaur lineage, and indeed some bird-like dinosaurs were already partway there. However, such an evolutionary outcome was far from inevitable. The humanoid body plan and our level of intellect arose from a unique combination of evolutionary happenstance, and a reptilian species would likely have taken a very different (and perhaps less human-looking) path even if it became intelligent. In reality, outside of birds, no reptilian species came close to the human level of cognition before nature\u2019s course changed.\n\nIn contrast, the **conspiracy theory perspective** treats humanoid reptilians not as a distant evolutionary \u201cwhat if,\u201d but as a literal secret existing here and now without scientific basis. These theories originated from imaginative fiction and have been woven into elaborate plots by modern conspiracy figures like David Icke. They claim that intelligent reptilian humanoids are already among us, yet the supporting \u201cevidence\u201d is essentially reinterpretations of myths, fictional tales, and unfounded allegations. Psychologically, the popularity of this theory stems more from human fear, pattern-seeking, and the allure of hidden knowledge than from any objective reality. While entertaining as science fiction or allegory, the reptilian conspiracy falls apart under critical scrutiny \u2013 it is not supported by evolutionary science, biology, or any verifiable data. \n\nIn closing, it\u2019s valuable to **separate science from fiction**. The idea of a reptilian species evolving toward human-like intelligence makes for a fascinating thought experiment grounded in evolutionary theory (with many caveats and uncertainties). On the other hand, contemporary claims that reptilian humanoids *already* walk among us belong to the realm of conspiracy lore, not science. Understanding why such conspiratorial beliefs arise and spread is a task for social science \u2013 one that reminds us how human psychology can sometimes lead us to see **lizard people in the shadows** even when the real answers lie in plain sight. \n\n"]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": true, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"citations": [{"start_ix": 1848, "end_ix": 1862, "citation_format_type": "tether_v4", "metadata": {"type": "webpage", "title": "Dinosauroid - Wikipedia", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinosauroid#:~:text=evolved%20into%20intelligent%20beings%20similar,1", "text": "evolved into intelligent beings similar in body plan to humans.
