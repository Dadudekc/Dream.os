What systems slow us down more—the tech or the way we use it?
Been doing some system audits today... mostly around how I’m handling the AI trade plans and content drops.
The AI’s generating decent insights—clean data, trade plans, sentiment scores... but there’s a bottleneck in how I’m packaging it for the outside. Too much manual intervention. I’m taking structured info and reformatting it every time I post. That’s time and energy I could automate.
Also noticing I’m layering on extra explanations and disclaimers in the content. Some of that is habit... trying to cover bases... but it’s diluting the clarity of the actual plan. If the AI already builds risk into the trade plan, I don’t need to re-explain it every time. Less noise. More precision.
What’s tricky is the fragmentation between trading, automation, and publishing. Right now, they’re running as separate workflows. That split is slowing me down. No real-time loop to adapt trade plans when sentiment shifts or new data comes in. I’m on manual updates... which means I’m behind the curve when the market moves fast.
Next up...
Build modular content templates so AI handles the formatting
Create a feedback loop that auto-updates trade plans and posts
Centralize all of it—trading signals, news sentiment, and content drops—into one control panel
Small wins... but this is the start of unifying the system.
