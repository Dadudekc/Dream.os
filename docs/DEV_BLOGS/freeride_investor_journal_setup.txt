Trading Journal Overhaul + System Audit Drop
“Where am I slowing myself down?”
That’s what hit me today...
I’ve been rebuilding the FreerideInvestor Trading Journal—tightening it for stocks and options. Clean fields. Clear risk calcs. A dashboard that tells you where you suck, where you’re improving. Feels good to have it mapped. But then I caught myself... going in circles on little tweaks that don’t move the needle.
The journal's structure is solid now.
Trade Log is set up for stocks + options—position sizing calcs automated, dropdowns simplified.
Risk Management sheet has clear input/output flow.
Dashboard is feeding back decent metrics, but needs more real data to stress test.
Built out the Options Analytics and Multi-Leg sheets... added test cases to make sure it's not just theory.
Then I stepped back and audited the whole workflow.
Where’s time leaking?
Where’s energy getting diluted?
It’s clear:
Too many micro-iterations.
Manual data handling is a choke point.
No real system for pushing this into multi-platform content yet.
I need to stop polishing mid-flight.
Lock version 1.0, test it in the wild, and iterate off feedback... not perfectionism.
Next step is migrating the whole backend off Excel into a relational setup (SQLite or straight Pandas). Automation is non-negotiable now—broker API pulls, real-time risk alerts, auto-generated trade summaries. Full loop.
Also working on a content pipeline so one build turns into multiple assets without me touching each step...
That’s where leverage lives.
If I’m gonna scale this, I need to stop playing wide and start going deep.
