Introspective Question:
How much time am I still spending fixing the same problems, instead of building systems that fix themselves?
Spent a chunk of time dissecting some recurring PHP errors on the FreeRideInvestor site...
Most of it was low-level stuff—warnings about widgets with missing titles, deprecated function calls in WP_User_Query, and a fatal error tied to an undefined constant in the theme. Basically, things that shouldn’t be stealing my time at this point, but they are... because the system isn’t self-correcting yet.
I’m still the bottleneck here.
The biggest drag? Manually sifting through raw logs instead of having a proper monitoring setup that flags and fixes—or at least alerts me—before something escalates. It’s reactive. Not where I want to be.
That became the pivot...
This system needs to move from task-based automation to full convergence. Trading data, site health, content analytics—all feeding into one place, driving decisions without me in the middle. AI-assisted testing, error monitoring with tools like Sentry, self-healing scripts... the works.
This is where I shift from reacting to architecting.
Next up...
Deploy Sentry for real-time error tracking.
Refactor the legacy WordPress code—clean up deprecated calls, modularize, and kill technical debt.
Start building the data pipeline that ties it all together.
Keep pulling myself out of the loop.
