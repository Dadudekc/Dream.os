Devlog: System First, Speed Second
How much time do we lose fixing things that should’ve been automated from the start…?
That’s what I’ve been thinking about today. I’ve been deep in Discord architecture… building the server out so it actually functions as a system... not just a bunch of channels that look pretty. But halfway through it, I realized I was getting dragged into micro-decisions that shouldn’t be on my desk. Roles, permissions, channel layouts… basic stuff. Necessary, but it was pulling me out of where I need to be—automation, AI, trading.
What I worked on:
Locked a modular Discord setup... Roles, channels, bots... done.
Wrote out the SOPs so someone else can run with it moving forward.
Streamlined the visuals and content flow… no more random channel clutter.
What broke:
Time. Spent too much of it tweaking design when I should’ve been delegating.
I was toggling between operator and visionary mode way too much... system fragmentation kills speed.
What’s next:
Moving operational execution off my plate—Discord, WordPress, all of it.
Automating content pushes so the machine runs whether I’m at the desk or not.
Refocusing on AI and trading systems… where the real leverage is.
Systems over speed. Speed comes from system.
