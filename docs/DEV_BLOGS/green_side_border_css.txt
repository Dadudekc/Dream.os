How much design do you actually need before the build starts slowing down?
I’ve been reworking the FreeRide Investor UI... dialing in the Exit Criteria section. Right now, there’s this glowing green box wrapping around the content. Feels too boxed-in... doesn’t match the flow I’m going for. I want it cleaner. Less of a container, more of a directional cue.
The goal is to turn that full border into a side border—something that feels like a structural line rather than a box. We’re moving toward simplicity. Less visual noise, more focus on the info.
Tweaked the CSS to strip the full border... swapped it for a left-side line. Green, same tone, but only on the edge. It’s subtle, but the layout breathes better now.
Still debating if I want a right-side line instead... but for now, this works.
Next up... cleaning the spacing and seeing how this flows on desktop vs mobile. I need this UI to stay light.
