TradingRobotPlug Build Log
How much time have I spent trying to control things that should already be automated?
That’s been the loop today... Wasted energy troubleshooting local MySQL when the real move is shifting to remote hosting and cleaning up the architecture.
I’ve been in the weeds with database connections... first WSL issues, then authentication plugins, now dealing with how fractured the dev environment feels. Spent way too much time fighting infrastructure when I should be scaling the system.
But the deeper realization is this—I'm still operating like a one-man builder... when I need to be the guy orchestrating the entire machine. I can get a system working with enough time and brute force, but the real leverage is in designing something that works without me sweating every line of code.
So... here’s what’s shifting.
I’m moving the entire database off local and onto PlanetScale or AWS RDS. That clears a ton of clutter from the dev process.
Refactoring TradingRobotPlug into modular pipelines is now a priority. No more monolith. I want plug-and-play components—data intake, strategy logic, execution, feedback—all separated.
Trade journaling is getting automated next. I’m tired of wasting time typing in trade notes manually. That’s a task for a bot... not me.
I’m also seriously thinking about bringing on an AI-assisted dev or freelancer to take on the stuff that doesn’t need me in the loop.
The big question for me this week has been about coding. Should I keep pushing to master it, or is "good enough" enough? After today... I’m leaning toward leverage. Still coding the high-impact pieces, but I’m not here to be a full-time engineer. I’m here to build the system that frees me—and everyone else using it.
Next move:
Remote DB migration (ASAP)
Refactor core components
Automate the post-trade feedback loop
Launch the first content funnel tied directly to TradingRobotPlug
One step at a time...
"Freedom isn't earned by doing more. It's earned by building what works without you."
