Devlog: What animal are you really moving like?
Been thinking about this today... how we label ourselves and whether it lines up with how we actually move.
I always thought maybe I was more lion energy—sovereign, territorial, guarding what I build. Or maybe owl energy... introspective, watching from the edges, only moving when the vision is crystal clear.
But after breaking it down, I’m moving more like a hawk right now. Fast adjustments. Scanning the whole system from altitude. Executing at speed. Not waiting, not watching—just seeing the full landscape and acting.
It got me thinking about how that applies to the system builds...
Not being stuck in observer mode. Not holding the line on some territory just because I built it. But constantly adjusting, adapting, and staying sharp enough to dive the second I spot something worth locking onto.
That’s where I’m at.
What’s next...
Revisiting the workflow again. Tighter loops. Less waiting, more acting. Every system needs to be able to shift with me when I shift. That’s the work. No shortcuts.
