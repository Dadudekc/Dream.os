Devlog // Patch Optimization + Test Debug
What if the missing pieces aren’t actually missing… just mislabeled?
That’s where my head’s been today... deep in the dependency trees and test failures, trying to untangle the mess from last night’s pytest run. Brutal. 77 tests... 21 errors... and most of them screaming about ModuleNotFoundError or some scipy/numpy binary mismatch. Classic.
I pulled the dependency map we generated—it’s clean, way more detailed than I expected. It gives a full breakdown of module dependencies and purpose (even if we’re missing docstrings everywhere... noted). That map basically handed me the blueprint to automate a lot of these fixes. Import paths? Cross-referencing internal dependencies? Rebuilding placeholder modules? All doable now.
Here’s where it got tricky:
Some of these errors are pathing issues... agents.core.api_client not found? It's there, but import paths are jacked.
Others are binary compatibility issues... numpy and scipy not playing nice. Py3.12 isn’t helping.
And there’s the classic Optional not defined in learning_db.py. Lazy import missed in review.
The plan I’m spinning up:
A fix script that cross-checks the map and scans for missing or broken imports.
Auto-inserts missing type hint imports like Optional where needed.
Rebuilds placeholder files when modules are called but don’t exist yet.
Forces reinstallation of numpy/scipy where version mismatches pop up.
This isn’t theoretical. The structure’s there... it just needs to be wired up tight. Probably dropping this into a auto_fix.py that runs pre-pytest. Thinking of chaining it with run_tests.py to create a loop until the system stabilizes.
What’s next?
Code the auto-fix scaffolding.
Stress-test it on the current errors.
Get it running as a pre-check before I touch anything manually again.
