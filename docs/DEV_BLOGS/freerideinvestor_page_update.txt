Devlog: What’s Slowing You Down Right Now?
Legit question I’ve been sitting with...
What’s the thing slowing me down right now... and how do I cut it?
Spent the last stretch cleaning up some messy workflows around the FreeRideInvestor Essentials plugin.
This was supposed to be a simple MVP... display some news, stock prices, sentiment data...
But it got messy because I didn’t set up the right systems from the jump.
The big drag?
Manual everything.
No version control.
No clean separation between dev and production.
API keys sitting in code...
And yeah... I slipped... keys got exposed...
Had to revoke and regenerate everything.
It’s a waste of time... but it’s the tax you pay when you move fast and loose without guardrails.
So I locked it down...
Git repo set up.
Keys moved into wp-config.php... but still thinking about better secrets management.
Clean folder structure.
Plugin is activating fine... shortcodes are rendering...
News, stocks, sentiment... data’s flowing.
What was tricky was realizing how much time I was losing just second-guessing basic stuff.
Should I use a template? Shortcodes?
Do I build it now or later?
Does this even matter?
I burned hours there...
Next step is codifying decisions before I even get to work... so there’s no loop.
Decide once... move.
No back and forth.
What’s next...
Automated testing on API calls.
Health checks with alerts.
Build out a clean dashboard for real-time data...
So it’s not just functional, but useful.
Also thinking through a unified data layer so everything feeds into one brain, not scattered scripts.
But yeah...
Moving cleaner now.
Faster too.
"Discipline is the shortcut."
Onward.
