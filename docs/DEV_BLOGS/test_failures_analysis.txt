What’s the real cost of keeping things fragmented... and how much energy gets wasted cleaning up after that?
Spent the last couple hours hammering through the DebugAgent and DebuggerAgent consolidation. The old structure was scattered—pieces everywhere... overlapping, inconsistent. Two separate agents both trying to own debugging, patching, and test cycles, but neither holding the line fully. Decided it was time to converge.
First step was merging both core classes. Took the cleanest parts of DebugAgent—structured retries, test cycles, patching logic—and brought in some of the raw flexibility from DebuggerAgent. Standardized LEARNING_DB_FILE and REPORT_ARCHIVE_DIR so they’re class-level, not floating around waiting to break things. Passed project_root cleanly through every init... no more guessing paths.
Ran the tests after the refactor—tons of AttributeError and TypeError around missing project_root and bad file references. Not unexpected... it’s what happens when you wire a system for clarity after it lived too long in duct tape. Cleaned up the constructor calls, enforced the checks on project_root, and made sure the archive directories get built if they’re missing. Pretty smooth after that.
Trickiest part was realizing how redundant a lot of the methods had become... and cutting through that without gutting something important. That’s where slowing down helped.
What’s next... I’m building a full test file to validate this merged agent in action. Need to pressure test the automated fix loop and make sure rollbacks don’t fail silently. Once that’s tight, I’ll roll it into the broader toolchain. Might hook it to a Discord webhook so I can trigger runs remotely. Keeping it clean.
