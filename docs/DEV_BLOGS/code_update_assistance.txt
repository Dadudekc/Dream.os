"Where is my system bleeding time... and where am I letting it?"
Been deep in the plugin architecture today. Two versions on the table: the legacy monolith and the modular rebuild. Spent way too long trying to merge them clean without losing the new stuff... and realized I was basically acting as middleware. Manually diffing code, line by line. That’s not it.
The bottlenecks are obvious now. Fragmented systems, redundant logic... logging handled differently in each file, asset management split all over. Cognitive overhead I didn’t clock until I stepped back.
The AI integrations are functional but not learning. Sentiment analysis pulls headlines, but there’s no feedback loop to validate it against actual market behavior. Same for the AI trade plans—they’re static. They don’t adjust or evolve when things play out differently.
What broke? My patience mostly... and the realization that decision debt stacks up fast when you don’t enforce convergence. No unified kernel. No clear system governance. Just me making micro-decisions that should be automated.
What’s next:
Build a unified core for the plugin—single source of truth for logs, assets, and settings.
Automate the merge workflows. AI-assisted diffs, regression checks, cut manual reviews down to zero.
Close the feedback loop on sentiment analysis and trade plans... make the system learn, adjust, and self-correct in real time.
Shift the trading workflows to event-driven automation. Reactivity beats planning every time in these markets.
And tighten up the shortcode rendering... fallback handling, no more fragility in template loads.
Feeling clear about the work. Focused on convergence.
No more wasted decisions.
