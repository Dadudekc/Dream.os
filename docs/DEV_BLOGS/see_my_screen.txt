Devlog 003 - "What happens when you remove the bottlenecks... and you’re still the bottleneck?"
Been thinking about that a lot today.
Spent the last few hours tearing apart my workflows… trading, automation, content systems—the whole stack. Found bottlenecks I knew were there… and some I didn’t want to admit.
I’ll keep this one tight.
What I worked on:
Refactored the trading pipeline. Exit automation is priority now. The emotional overhead of manually managing trades is killing execution speed. I can follow my plan up until the part where I’m supposed to let winners run… and I just don’t. Solution: enforce trailing stops + rule-based exits inside the bot. Human out of the loop.
Looked hard at the server traffic logs. Had a suspicious IP hammering admin-ajax.php and cron. Dug into it… probably LiteSpeed Cache, but I’m rate-limiting it anyway. Automated traffic management is going in. No more manual checks.
The content flow’s clunky. Rewrote some stuff today… realized I shouldn’t have to. Building a tone framework and template system so I can drop posts or updates without thinking about the tone. Keep it raw, keep it real, but cut out the friction.
What broke or was tricky:
The server log analysis ate more time than I wanted. Still too manual. That’s getting automated this week.
Realized I was splitting trade reviews and dev reflections across different notes… redundancy. That’s getting merged into one AI-powered feedback system. No more scatter.
What’s next:
Build the automated trade journal. Needs to track adherence vs. deviation. Behavior analytics… not just P&L.
AI server traffic manager goes live by the end of the week.
Finish the Blender auto-render pipeline. No more babysitting renders.
