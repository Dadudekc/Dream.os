Devlog: Are detours really detours... or just the way?
Been thinking about this a lot...
How sometimes it feels like you’re getting pulled off track, but then you look back and realize... you were building the thing you needed all along.
That’s where I’m at.
What I worked on:
Spent the last stretch tightening up three core builds:
Stock Analysis Tool
Smart Asset Allocator
Deep Learning Trading Robot
Each of these started as isolated projects... now they’re aligned. They’re modular, clean, and ready to plug into the bigger picture—whether that’s education content or tooling for people to actually use. No wasted effort... just sharpening tools that I can repurpose.
Also locked in an AI-driven content pipeline. This was a drag before... I’d write README files, docs, and lessons by hand... over and over. Now it’s automated. Ollama + ChatGPT handle it. Feed them the code, and they spit out clean content.
Frees up a lot of bandwidth...
No more context-switching just to push updates.
What broke / got tricky:
Focus...
I was spread too thin. Parallel-building three projects sounds efficient... until it isn’t. The friction showed up in decision fatigue—what gets priority? What’s the end goal?
Had to step back...
Realized everything needs to flow toward FreeRideInvestor, and more specifically... getting TBoW dialed in and deployed.
Now the dev cycles are aligned.
If it doesn’t serve the platform or the courses... it doesn’t get built.
What’s next:
Finalizing TBoW tactics display... getting this clean and functional.
Reworking the educational courses pipeline to include the new tools.
Tightening the AI task governor to manage focus... no more guessing what’s next, it’ll prompt me.
"Sometimes the work that feels like a detour... is just taking the direct route you couldn’t see yet."
Back at it.
More soon.
