Devlog: Cleaning Up the Core
Is clarity always on the other side of complexity… or do we just get better at cutting through the noise?
Spent today deep in the guts of the Fintech Engine… basically rebuilding the core to make it cleaner, tighter, and way more functional. The old version worked… but it was bloated. Too many placeholders. Too many half-finished ideas that were slowing the whole thing down. So I stripped it down, refactored the API manager, cleaned up the shortcodes, rewired the admin settings, and made sure the portfolio optimizer actually runs without throwing errors every third cycle.
One of the trickiest parts was balancing the Reinforcement Learning and Genetic Algorithms… they were both running, but it wasn’t clean. There was redundancy, overlap, and it was messing with the execution flow. Ended up streamlining the optimization loop so it’s lighter and faster. Still needs tuning, but it’s clean.
Also… the Mailchimp flows are finally working the way I wanted. No more random failures when someone subscribes or submits a form. It’s smooth.
The hardest part wasn’t the code. It was deciding what to cut… and having the patience to rebuild it the right way.
What’s next…
I want to harden the trade execution and portfolio updates…
Start testing this against live data in a sandboxed environment…
And get the content generation pipelines feeding into the front-end cleanly.
One step at a time.
