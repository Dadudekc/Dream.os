Devlog Entry | 02.12.25
Do you ever wonder if the thing holding you back isn’t complexity… but clarity?
That’s where I’m at right now.
Today wasn’t about shipping something new. It was about looking at everything I’ve already built… and realizing I’ve been making things way harder than they need to be.
I went deep on the project structure… stripped out a ton of fluff in the process.
Cleaned up the blog templates—ditched all the leftover placeholders and broken loops that shouldn’t have made it into the final version… that was bugging me for a while.
Took what was originally a giant, tangled block of HTML and rewrote it into something clean… fluid.
The goal was simple: merge personal reflection with the roadmap of my work… and make it feel like something real—not a checklist.
Also been thinking about how to balance building for myself versus building for hundreds…
That tension is real.
The insight?
Start with the one… build for the one… then expand without diluting the core.
That’s where I’m focused now.
What’s next…
Polishing the writing prompts so the system never leaves junk code behind.
Making sure every part of this process is seamless—for me, and whoever’s watching.
Still a long way to go…
But I’m finally seeing the difference between movement and progress.
“Simplicity isn’t the absence of complexity… it’s the clarity to know what matters.”
