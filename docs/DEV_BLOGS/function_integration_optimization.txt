Devlog // March 14
Ever ask yourself if you’re actually converging... or just adding more layers?
Today was one of those days where I had to step back and look at the system as a whole. We’ve been moving fast—building agents, patch generators, test runners—but there’s fragmentation creeping in. Redundancies in patch generation logic... models all doing their own thing without a unified intelligence driving the calls... performance data scattered across JSONs like breadcrumbs with no real feedback loop in place. I realized it’s slowing the system down in ways that aren’t obvious until you zoom out.
The audit helped. Got real about where time and energy are getting diluted. The main choke point? Too many overlapping components trying to solve the same problem. Multiple fallback chains across different agents. Patch retries handled by different managers with no shared intelligence. Some parts async, some not. The system’s clever... but not smart enough yet.
What broke? Nothing catastrophic. But the moment you see inefficiency, it’s already breaking the system. It’s death by a thousand paper cuts unless you converge.
What’s next:
Collapsing AIPatchUtils and AIPatchManager into one unified patch engine.
AIConfidenceManager becomes the real-time brain—routing model calls, scoring patches, controlling retries without human oversight.
Asynchronous execution standardized across everything. No more blocking subprocess calls.
Autonomous test creation and refactor loop needs to be fully hands-off by the next sprint.
AI Content Agent moves up in priority... every patch, every debug cycle needs to generate content that feeds the loop.
This isn’t about shipping more... it’s about collapsing complexity into force.
