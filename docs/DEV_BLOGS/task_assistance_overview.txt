Where is my time and energy getting diluted?
Been sitting with that today... and running a system audit on how I’m actually using ChatGPT inside FreeRideInvestor.
Realized I’ve been underutilizing it—mostly treating it like a Q&A tool instead of locking it into roles that can run parts of the system without me needing to hand-hold it every time. That’s friction. It slows everything down... content creation, trading workflows, even automation builds. Cognitive switching and decision fatigue creep in fast when I’m the bottleneck for every micro-task.
What I worked on:
Broke the system down into the three pillars again... Trading, Automation, Content.
Mapped out how ChatGPT should run inside each one. It needs clear roles and KPIs... not open-ended questions.
Started drafting out the playbooks that need to get codified. Daily trading logs, pre/post-market checklists, content frameworks, and automation QA loops.
What was tricky:
The bottleneck isn’t tech... it’s me holding all the decision nodes. That’s where the dilution happens. If I’m context-switching, the system slows... if ChatGPT runs convergence reviews and makes decisions inside clear rules, the system stays fast.
What’s next:
Codify the playbooks and load them into ChatGPT
Assign clear roles, starting with Content Strategist
Set up weekly AI-led convergence reviews across all pillars
Kill unnecessary context switching... persistent threads only from here
Build out decision protocols so I’m not babysitting
This is about system convergence and flow... clearing noise so velocity can happen.
