Devlog: Tightening the System
What’s the real cost of letting small inefficiencies slide?
That’s the question I kept circling back to today...
I went deep into system audit mode—trading, automation, content flow… all of it. The bottlenecks were obvious once I slowed it down and looked at the friction points. Manual trading decisions... overcomplicated indicator setups... redundant cron jobs running in the background like silent energy drains.
The TBOW setup works. We know that. But I’ve been too hands-on with it—still watching RSI, Bollinger Bands, MACD like a hawk when I should be automating entries and exits. The move today was solid—took 15% off the table, stuck to the plan. But that manual piece… it’s a bottleneck. Can’t scale speed or focus when I’m babysitting the charts.
The content side had its own clutter. TBOW tactics were being updated manually. Too slow. No connection between the live trading insights and the front-facing content. That got addressed—working on making that dynamic and automated now so the site updates in real time, no extra energy wasted.
Biggest pain point? The cron job that kept breaking because of a missing class. Took time to spot it... that’s time I shouldn’t be burning on code that’s supposed to just work. Cleaned up the redundant processes… centralizing data feeds next.
What’s next…
→ Automate the TBOW entries/exits completely
→ Build the journaling system to auto-log trades
→ Keep tightening the loops… less friction, more flow
This is about execution speed now. Precision.
Stacking small wins… no fluff.
