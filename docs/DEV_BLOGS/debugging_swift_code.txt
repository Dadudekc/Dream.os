What’s the real cost of attention drift?
Been thinking about that a lot today… mostly because I caught myself debugging Swift code for a friend and realized—this isn’t where my energy should be. Not right now.
I broke the flow. Context switched out of system convergence into something that, honestly, didn’t move anything forward on my end. It wasn’t about the Swift… it was about noticing the leakage. Time, focus, decision weight… all getting siphoned off by things that aren’t tied to the system I’m building.
So… I stepped back and audited myself mid-task.
Saw the patterns pretty clearly:
No filtration system on inbound requests.
Too much manual problem-solving on things that aren’t core.
Pulling in generalized info instead of tight, system-specific knowledge.
That realization stung a little... but it’s clean data.
What’s tricky here is energy management at scale. These little “favors” or distractions stack up… and they slow the loop. No triage layer means I’m letting anything through the gate. That doesn’t work if I’m serious about self-replicating systems.
So, I mapped out a fix:
First move: build an AI-driven triage layer. No more manual sorting.
Codify the common troubleshooting flows—delegate or automate anything that doesn’t demand my decision weight.
Dial in the knowledge pipeline… AI agents pulling only what’s relevant to the build. No fluff. No research rabbit holes.
Next, I’m focusing on codifying these triage rules. Priority filter first.
This is about attention integrity now.
