"Where is the system still asking for my time when it should be self-moving?"
Been thinking about that a lot today... because it’s clear the builds are moving, but I’m still stepping in too often. Manual processes where there shouldn’t be any... distractions I thought I cleared already.
Started by tightening up the character creation flow in the Superpowered TTRPG system. The old setup had me (or any player) dumping points one by one into attributes, and it was clunky. Slow. Repetitive. So I rebuilt it—batch assignment now. You drop in your final attribute numbers and the system handles the cost validation. Less friction, cleaner flow. It’s not flashy but it works... and the time savings compound when you’re testing over and over.
Then I circled back to Mistral 7B running locally through Ollama. Caught a bug where the system couldn’t talk to the model... turned out it was an issue with the model naming—should’ve been mistral:latest, not mistral-7b. Cleaned that up, dropped in some better error logging. Now, if Ollama chokes, it tells me exactly why instead of giving me a mystery box. Less guessing, more building.
After all that, I stepped back and asked myself... where’s the single system that runs all of this without me babysitting it?
So I sketched out a class-based orchestrator that pulls trading logic, content generation, and task automation into one shot. Not live yet—but the bones are there. TradingAI handles the market calls (rudimentary for now), ContentGenerator spits out dynamic assets, and the SystemOrchestrator manages the flow. It’s clean... no unnecessary loops... runs in one pass... exactly how I want my systems to move.
What’s next:
Swapping out the stubbed trading logic for an actual RL model
Building the orchestration into the main trading and content pipelines
Maybe wrapping it all in a lightweight API or web UI so I can trigger the whole thing from anywhere...
I’m hunting for convergence... where the system becomes something I don’t have to think about.
"If you’re tired, do it tired."
Let’s move.
