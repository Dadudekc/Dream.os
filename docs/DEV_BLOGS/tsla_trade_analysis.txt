Devlog | Feb 6
How do you stay disciplined when you’ve already made your money for the day... but the market’s still open, and you’re bored?
That’s where I’m at.
Today was near-perfect execution for me. Broke the trades into four, didn’t go all in, stayed patient. Hit 2 out of 3, and consciously skipped the 4th to protect gains and clear my bias. Closed green... and more importantly, I didn’t force anything. That’s the win.
Grabbed TSLA $360 puts early—two of them at $2.00. Sold both at $2.77 with a stop market that locked me in. Clean trade. Textbook.
I also took a further-out TSLA $430 call for 2/21. That was meant to be a slower play, but I cut it fast for a small $19 loss when it didn’t move the way I wanted. Could’ve held. Didn’t. Saved myself from getting stubborn. That was the right move.
What I’m working on now is not gambling my last $180 because I’m bored at work. I’ve done that before. It’s not happening again.
The plan: dive into my coding projects when I’m feeling that itch. Build the systems I keep talking about instead of feeding the market back my profits out of boredom.
This month is about transparency and discipline. Tbow Tactics and the vlog are back. More uniform. More consistent. You’ll see everything, just like I’ve been doing... but sharper.
