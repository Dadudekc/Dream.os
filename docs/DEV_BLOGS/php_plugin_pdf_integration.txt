“Where is the system still leaking time?”
Been deep in the weeds today... combing through the FreerideInvestor build, trying to spot where the workflows are slowing me down. Pretty surgical audit—trading, automation, content generation. All of it.
What I’m seeing is this:
The API requests are stacking up...
Every time I fetch stock data, run sentiment, or pull a trade plan from OpenAI, I’m hitting separate calls. That’s killing velocity. Feels small at first, but over time... it adds up.
Also, the alert system—too much overhead. It’s checking each alert like it’s on an island... instead of batching them together. That needs to change.
And the logging... it’s everywhere. Every request, every action. I don’t need that level of noise. Not in production.
What was tricky:
Balancing detailed logs for debugging without choking system performance. Plus, figuring out how aggressive I can go with caching before it starts feeling stale for users.
What’s next:
Consolidate API calls—get data, sentiment, and plans in one hit where I can
Batch process alert checks so I’m not wasting cycles
Cut the log spam... move to async or external storage
Crank up caching for historical data and sentiment... keep it lean
Time to clear out the noise and speed things up.
