How do you build something powerful... and still make it dead simple to use?
Been sitting with that question while I hammer out this UI for the AI Debugger MVP. The backend's been solid for a minute—agents running, patching, journaling, all that—but when I wired it into PyQt5, it hit me... if I don’t intuitively get how to use this thing, what’s the point?
So today was about stripping things back and forcing clarity.
I pulled in the ProjectSetupTab, the ApplyFixTab, and the DebuggingOrchestratorTab I had already scaffolded... then added a ProjectContextTab to visualize the project structure JSON. That last one was a game-changer. Now I can load up the dependency map, search modules, and get a clean tree view of the project. Super basic, but super effective.
The biggest trip-up? Forgetting to import QTreeWidgetItem... classic. Whole JSON context feature wouldn’t load because of one missing line. Fixed that, rebuilt the tree filter logic so I can drill down clean.
After that, I rewired some flow on the Debugging Orchestrator... made the start session, document resolution, and summarize workflows a little smoother. Took out the unnecessary noise. If it doesn’t add speed, it’s out.
What's next...
Need to get the agents actively filling the Learning DB. No more passive data collection... it's gotta be automated. Thinking task queues, scheduled runs, maybe even a trigger off test failures. That’s where the learning loop tightens up.
But for now... the UI’s functional, cleaner, and I’m starting to feel how this thing works in real time.
