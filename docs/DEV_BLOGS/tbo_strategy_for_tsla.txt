Devlog: Sticking to the Plan
What’s the point of having a plan if you don’t stick to it…?
That’s been sitting with me heavy today. I ran the setup clean at the open… bought the call on the dip, sold into strength… booked $179 on the morning rip. Easy work. The plan worked because I followed it. Simple.
Then I broke it.
I got cocky. Thought the downtrend was setting up… switched my bias without waiting for confirmation… bought puts… then averaged down when it went against me. Took the stop off, held too long… all the things I said I wouldn’t do. Ended the day red… gave back $141 of what should’ve been a lock.
The plan was fine. I just didn’t follow it.
So that’s the work… it’s not the system, it’s me. Discipline’s gotta be system enforced from now on. Auto-stop loss… post-win cooldown periods… limit how many trades I can take after hitting profit targets. Remove the emotion as much as I can and let the system run it. I’ll still pull the trigger… but the rails need to be tighter.
Next up—building those guardrails. Small account or not, discipline’s the edge… and right now, I’m dulling it by breaking my own rules.
“Stick to the plan. The hard part isn’t knowing it… it’s not breaking it.”
Onward.
