How much time am I spending where it doesn’t need to be spent... and how fast can I fix that?
Worked through tightening up the TBOW tactic process today...
Breaking it down for TSLA at $410.50...EMA, RSI, MACD...
But the real focus wasn’t the chart...it was where I’m losing time and why.
The content side’s where I feel the biggest drag...
Rewriting the same post across Stocktwits, Discord, LinkedIn, Facebook, Instagram...
Slight tweaks, different tones, platform stuff...
It adds up...
And it’s a waste when the core insight doesn’t change.
Also spotted a bigger problem...
Manual chart reads...no automated triggers for TBOW setups.
I’m scanning...thinking...then writing...
By the time I’m done, I’m late.
Or second-guessing.
Either way, not fast enough.
Started mapping out how to automate the core playbook alerts...
EMA crosses...RSI oversold...MACD divergences...
Real-time flags...with volume confirmation.
That’s where I’m heading.
On the content side...
Going to build a system that atomizes the base idea across platforms...
Once. Clean. Done.
Visual templates...locked in.
Hashtag libraries...pre-built.
Execution...velocity.
Next steps...
Priority one—get the TBOW trigger alerts firing in real time.
Priority two—lock in the content atomization framework.
Once that’s in place...
Everything else gets faster.
"Clarity comes from execution...not thought."
