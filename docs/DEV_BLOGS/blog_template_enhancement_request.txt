What’s the cost of doing something manually... when it should’ve been automated weeks ago?
Been sitting with that one today.
Went deep on the system audit... trading, automation, content flow.
The loop is getting tighter, but there’s friction in places I shouldn’t be touching anymore.
What stood out...
I’m still manually structuring trading plans...
Still babysitting CSS when the theme should be locked...
Still repeating tone instructions to AI that should already know how I write.
It’s small stuff... but small stuff compounds into wasted time.
If I’m honest, it’s slowing the system down.
So here’s where I’m pivoting:
— Automating the tactical playbook generator. No more manual trade plan write-ups. The AI should handle the initial draft, based on data feeds... I just edit and execute.
— Building a universal theme component library. No more adjusting margins and colors in the middle of a content build. One decision... everywhere.
— Codifying content governance. Lock in tone, structure, and design rules... so AI outputs hit 90% without rewrites.
— Setting up an immutable decision log. If I make a call, it’s the rule now. No more re-deciding.
That’s the focus... convergence and velocity.
No more energy leaks.
