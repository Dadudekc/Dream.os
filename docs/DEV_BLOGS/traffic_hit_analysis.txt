How much time do I lose chasing noise instead of building clarity?
Been sitting with that today...
I ran the numbers on my site—30,000 hits in the last week. At first, it felt wild... until I remembered most of that was me hammering the site while debugging plugins. Classic.
The problem isn’t the number... it’s the signal pollution. What I’m seeing isn’t what’s real—it’s noise I’m generating just by working inside the system.
And that’s the issue...
If I’m doing this on the site, how often am I doing it in trading? In automation? How often is my own manual intervention muddying the data I’m trying to trust?
Today was about getting surgical with that realization.
I broke it down and found a few things that need to change immediately:
IP filtering on all analytics—my traffic doesn’t belong in the data
Excluding admin and logged-in user hits from tracking
I need automated test pipelines... no more manual plugin debugging inflating numbers
Real-time data filtering needs to happen pre-ingestion across everything, not just on the site
And I’m building a clean dashboard that pulls real signals only... no more context-switching between tools trying to figure out what’s true
The biggest shift is carving a clear line between what the automation handles and where I step in... no more blurring roles. That’s where the system starts slowing down.
Next up...
I’m getting the automated testing up in the next 72 hours
Refining the trading data filters next week
Unified dashboard build kicks off after that
The faster I move on this, the clearer everything else gets.
