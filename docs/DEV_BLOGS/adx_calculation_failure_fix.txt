Devlog: Are we really building systems that free us… or just adding more noise?
Today was one of those days where I had to sit with that question...
I’ve been all over the place lately, jumping between ideas, but I locked in on finishing this TSLA trading bot.
I had to.
Felt like it was getting in the way of everything else because I kept leaving it half-done.
So here’s what went down...
I spent most of the day debugging the bot. The core was solid, but I ran into a nasty issue with indicator calculations breaking—ADX and MACD were throwing negative dimensions errors. Classic case of not having enough data in the DataFrame for the rolling windows.
Obvious in hindsight, but it was a mess to untangle in the moment.
I added stricter checks to make sure the bot won’t even try to calculate if the data’s thin.
Also caught a bug in backtesting where signals weren’t lining up with the positions. Had to go back through the logic... realized I was assuming the bot would reverse positions instantly without properly exiting. Rookie mistake, but I cleaned it up.
The tests helped.
I pushed hard on edge cases today—immediate stop losses, profit targets getting hit right after entry, all that.
The backtest is holding up now... signals make sense... positions are clean.
Logger’s tight. I’m getting the feedback I need when things move.
Not gonna lie, I burned an hour and a half on Brawlhalla...
Didn’t get my TBOW tactic out.
Could’ve spent that time tightening things up or writing, but whatever...
I’m back in the pocket now.
Next step...
Finish wiring the bot into a live feed and stop trading manually. I’m tired of being the bottleneck on my own execution.
This bot needs to run without me babysitting it.
