Devlog // Sniper System Build
03.15.25
How much time do I lose rebuilding things that should already be modular?
That’s what hit me today...
Was working on the Sniper Entry System strategy in Pine.
Mean reversion... Bollinger Bands... MACD curls... all the usual suspects.
But halfway through, I realized I’m writing the same base components I’ve written a dozen times before.
RSI logic. Bollinger Band structures. MACD slopes.
It’s not complex, but it’s redundant...
And every time I hit another type error or dumb operator logic bug, it slows me down.
I’m still debugging reactively, when I should be building proactively.
The VWAP issue was simple... I fed it volume instead of length because I didn’t have a clean framework set up.
The operator bug? Parentheses—again.
Wasted cycles.
Not major... but enough to break flow.
So here’s the takeaway...
I need a modular PineScript framework.
Components I can snap together without rewriting them every time.
And I need an AI layer that checks syntax and logic before I run anything.
I’m tired of catching simple stuff after the fact.
Also... a parameter optimizer.
Right now, tuning RSI thresholds and ATR stops is guesswork.
I can automate that.
If I’m serious about scaling this, I can’t afford manual calibration on every run.
What’s next...
Drafting the modular component library—indicators, entries, exits.
Starting the AI prompt validator for Pine.
Building out the Python-based hyperparameter tuner.
Automation pipeline with performance alerts... so I know immediately if something breaks or underperforms.
