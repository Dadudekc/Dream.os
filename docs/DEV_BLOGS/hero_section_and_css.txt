“What’s the cost of trying to do everything by hand?”
Been sitting with that today...
Most of the last build session was deep in the weeds of front-end structure. Cleaning up the Dev Blog page, the Tools Archive, and refactoring the CSS. It started simple—fixing the spacing at the bottom of the page. Then I realized... the system’s bloated. Inline styles everywhere, layout tweaks dragging on. Every adjustment slows the whole thing down.
Manually pushing layout changes, rechecking responsiveness, hunting for inconsistencies... it’s a loop I keep running. And it’s killing velocity. This was supposed to be clean. Fluid. But the system’s not there yet.
What worked—
✅ Cleaned up the Dev Blog hero section
✅ Got the grid interfaces structured
✅ Fixed mobile stacking and spacing
✅ Locked in the color consistency across sections
What broke or got messy—
⚠️ Inline styling... again
⚠️ Wasted cycles adjusting margins and paddings that should’ve been standardized
⚠️ Not enough automation on content updates—still hand-triggered deployments
What’s next...
I need to rip out all inline styles and move to a proper component-based system. Tailwind or Figma tokens, not sure yet... but the design system has to be modular and automated.
Also need CI/CD in place to kill the manual deploy loop. AI’s already handling heavy lifting on other parts of the system... it should be pushing updates too.
And I’m going to wire trading data into the front-end content—real-time insights, not static text. Everything in sync.
This is convergence work. Pulling it all together. No more scattered systems.
