Question I’m sitting with today:
Where am I still operating when I should be architecting?
Spent the day tearing down some of the friction in my workflow...
Mostly around how much time I’ve been burning on micro-decisions that don’t need me in the loop.
Content generation was a big one.
Realized I’ve been tweaking posts and visuals by hand—one at a time—when I should already have a system doing this clean, first pass.
Simple stuff like removing em dashes, auto-hashtagging key terms, pre-setting tone...
That should be baked in. No reason for me to still be stepping in on that.
Visual assets too.
Ran through three cycles of image revisions just to remove text.
That should be batch automated—pick 5, kill the rest, deploy.
Right now, it’s bottlenecked because I haven’t codified the SOP.
Trading workflows came up in this audit too.
I’m still too close to the risk management and scaling systems...
If AI can already handle dynamic position sizing and portfolio balancing, why am I still auditing every piece manually?
Need to move toward autonomous agents with only edge-case reviews.
That’s the next layer of convergence.
What broke today?
My own operating system, honestly.
Too many decisions still flow through me... and that’s capping velocity.
System needs to be self-driving at this point.
What’s next:
Build out a content generation template so AI can draft 90% without me.
SOP for visual asset creation... batch generation, batch removal, deploy fast.
Finalize risk management and portfolio agents—full auto, no manual audits unless triggered.
Weekly convergence reviews to stay out of the weeds.
