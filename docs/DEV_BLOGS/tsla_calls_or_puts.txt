Devlog // 2025-03-16 // TSLA Trades + Market News Build
“At what point does patience cross the line into stubbornness... and how do you catch yourself before you’re deep in it?”
Today was rough on the trading side. Got caught holding TSLA puts way longer than I should’ve. The plan was there—cut if $348 broke. It broke... and I stayed in. Watched it rip through $350, then $356... all while I’m sitting on hands, waiting for some magical reversal that wasn’t coming.
I told myself I was waiting for the tariff news drop at noon. It came. But that wasn’t strategy... that was hope.
On the system side, made some moves. Started laying the groundwork for the Market News app. Priority is caching API responses once an hour, with a manual “Fetch Now” trigger for admin. First pass of the PHP script is done, but had to shift it so the API key pulls from wp-config.php instead of being hardcoded. No excuses on security or best practice, even if it’s just v1.
Haven’t tested it fully yet—need to drop it into the WP backend and wire up the admin page. That’ll be next.
Biggest takeaway from today: if the plan is there, execute it. Don’t sit there hoping your bad play turns good. Respect the system... or pay the price.
