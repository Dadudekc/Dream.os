Devlog: How much energy are you leaking without realizing it?
Been thinking about bandwidth today… not just time, but actual mental and emotional energy. How much gets drained before we even notice?
Had to step back and look at where I’m losing focus… and it’s clear. Personal stuff… hard convos… things that don’t directly move the system forward. I hit a point where it’s not sustainable. Doesn’t matter how dialed in my trading is or how clean the automation scripts are—if I’m drained from side battles, it all slows down.
So I started working on a boundary system today. Simple… clear… direct. Wrote out a basic script for tough convos so I’m not burning cycles figuring it out every time. Set some rules for when I engage and when I don’t. And if someone crosses the line… there’s a pre-built response that protects my headspace. No more letting things pile up until they explode.
What was tricky? Honestly… recognizing how reactive I’ve been. I’ve been letting things hit me when they happen, instead of building systems that prevent it in the first place. That’s a hole in the stack… and it’s on me to fix it.
What’s next…
Deploy these boundaries in real-time.
Lock in strict time windows for any non-core stuff.
And keep building out ways to automate my energy, not just my code.
Protect the system… protect the flow.
