"Am I focusing on the work that actually moves the needle... or am I just staying busy?"
Been thinking about that heavy today.
Started out wanting to build this Mock Generator tool—partly to help BlaiseLabs, partly to test out Replit... but halfway through, realized I was scattering my focus. Way too many threads open in my brain right now. TradingRobotPlug. FreeRide Investor. Vlog Forge. Plus this whole automated $1/day experiment.
System audit made it obvious... I’ve been diffusing energy when I should be stacking it.
So I paused.
Re-ran the priorities. If I’m serious about scaling, I need to put everything through the same lens:
Does it automate?
Does it generate income?
Does it self-optimize?
If not... it’s a side quest.
The Mock Generator is cool... but it’s not core. Not yet.
Right now, the path is simple:
1️⃣ Focus the system on TradingRobotPlug and FreeRide Investor.
2️⃣ Lock in a monetization loop—one income stream that runs itself.
3️⃣ Build AI feedback loops into the core systems so they evolve without me.
That’s the next push.
