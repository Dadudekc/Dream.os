Devlog // AI Debug & Execution Loop Overhaul
Ever wonder how many systems you can run at once before something cracks?
...yeah. Me too.
The last couple days have been all about tightening the bolts on the AI execution loops. Specifically, I’ve been breaking down where things are dragging—whether it’s in the code refactor cycles, trade execution, or the content loops I’m trying to automate.
Here’s what I found...
The DebugAgent, AutoFixManager, and FunctionRefactorer? Redundant. Too much overlap. They were all doing similar jobs—spotting bugs, suggesting patches, and then validating the fixes—but they weren’t sharing a brain. So I’m merging them. Single unified agent that handles detection, fixes, validation, and feeds it all back into the LearningDB. No more handoffs. That should cut latency on refactor cycles down a lot.
Speaking of LearningDB, I upgraded it. Now it tracks confidence scores, success counters, timestamps... and supports fuzzy matching on error messages. Basically, it’s smarter about what it knows and when it should try to help. If a fix works, we log that. If it doesn’t, we learn. Clean loop.
Also caught myself in a pattern of double-logging things across different agents. Wasted cycles. Killed it. Unified logging pipeline is in now... single source of truth, less noise.
On the trading side, I’m still running manual reinforcement when trades go sideways. That’s gotta go. Next move is building out an Edge Discovery Engine that finds new trade setups, backtests them, and pushes them live without me touching it. Losses become training data. No more emotional loops.
Content flow’s next. Right now I’m still pushing devlogs manually. I want it tied to code pushes—every milestone kicks out a post, vlog script, or thread. Repurposed automatically. If you’re seeing this, yeah, I’m still doing it by hand. Not for long.
What was tricky? Deciding what to merge without killing flexibility. Some of these systems were designed to be modular. Collapsing them into one agent was a risk, but the latency tradeoff is worth it.
What’s next?
Deploy the Execution Sentinel to prioritize and monitor the loops in real-time.
Get the Edge Discovery Engine running on historical data.
Build out the Content Syndication Engine so this devlog writes itself next time.
“You can’t automate what you haven’t owned first.”
Back to it.
