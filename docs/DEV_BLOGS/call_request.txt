Devlog 03.15.25
“What’s slowing me down that I’m not noticing?”
Been thinking on this hard today... I’m doing the work—trading, reflecting, running the site, writing the blog... but I’m getting spread thin. And not in a “I need to grind harder” way. In a “this isn’t the best use of my time” way.
This VLOG series for FreeRide Investor has been on my mind. I’m already trading every day. Already reflecting. Already building the blog posts. Turning that into video content just makes sense... and I know video will connect deeper. A lot of people won’t read long posts, but they’ll sit and watch a raw conversation where I’m just breaking things down... smoking, decompressing, unpacking the day—the good, bad, and ugly.
But I’ve got bottlenecks.
I’m editing videos myself.
Scheduling posts manually.
Uploading blogs.
Engaging solo in the comments...
And that’s not where my time should be going.
If it takes longer than 15 minutes, I’m either automating it or outsourcing it. Full stop.
What I worked on:
Broke down my workflow.
Mapped out a streamlined system: trading → reflect → record → batch upload raw footage → outsourced edits → automated distribution.
Defined templates for everything: video scripts, blog structures, social posts... all designed to hand off cleanly.
What broke or was tricky:
Realized I’m still trying to do everything myself because I’ve been building this solo for so long.
Letting go of tasks is going to take some practice... but it has to happen.
I’m over-investing time in small execution details when I should be focusing on strategy and system convergence.
What’s next:
Hire an editor. Already have the role mapped out.
Build out my Notion command center for content workflows.
Hire a community manager to handle day-to-day engagement.
Automate Tbow Tactics trade plan delivery—email, dashboard, whatever scales.
Batch record the next 3-5 VLOG episodes. Raw, personal, no polish.
The faster I get these pieces moving without me, the more time I have for trading mastery and system optimization.
