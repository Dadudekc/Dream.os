Prompt for Updating FreerideInvestor AI Market News Plugin
Objective:
I need to debug and improve the FreerideInvestor AI Market News plugin to ensure that it:
Successfully fetches market news from the Yahoo Finance API.
Stores fetched news in the WordPress database (market_news table).
Displays market news on both the admin dashboard and the frontend.
Supports manual fetching via the admin panel.
Provides a working API endpoint to retrieve market news via AJAX.
Retains all functionality my dad previously built, especially caching and integrations with Discord and Mailchimp, unless absolutely necessary to remove.
Fixes the current errors (e.g., missing function callbacks, invalid API responses, or caching issues).
Current Issues:
Function fetch_market_news_callback is not found.
This function is referenced in add_action('wp_ajax_fetch_market_news_callback', 'fetch_market_news_callback') but doesn't exist in the main plugin file.
I need to define this function and confirm that it properly calls fimn_fetch_market_news().
API Key is missing or undefined.
The plugin is using FIMN_API_KEY, which is defined as YAHOO_FINANCE_API_KEY.
I need to confirm that YAHOO_FINANCE_API_KEY is correctly set in the WordPress configuration or replace it with a secure method of storing API keys.
News fetch sometimes returns empty or invalid data.
The API response check (if (!is_array($news_data) || empty($news_data['items']))) may not be handling errors properly.
I need to add better error handling to debug failed fetch attempts.
Caching could be interfering with updates.
The get_transient() function in Market_News_Fetcher::get_sentiment() caches results for 24 hours (DAY_IN_SECONDS).
If real-time news updates are needed, I may need to disable or modify caching.
Admin fetch button might not be triggering correctly.
Need to confirm fimn_fetch_market_news() runs when manually triggered via the admin panel.
Database writes might be failing.
The wpdb->insert() function checks for existing entries before adding new ones.
I need to confirm that the UNIQUE KEY constraint (title, published_at) allows legitimate news articles to be saved.
Plan of Action:
Fix the missing function callback (fetch_market_news_callback).
Add the function in the main plugin file and ensure it properly calls fimn_fetch_market_news().
Ensure API key is properly loaded.
Check if YAHOO_FINANCE_API_KEY is defined in wp-config.php or provide an alternative method to retrieve it.
Improve error logging for API failures.
Log full API responses when wp_remote_get() fails.
If news_data is empty, display an admin notice.
Decide on caching adjustments.
If real-time news updates are required, remove get_transient() from the sentiment analysis.
If caching remains, provide an option in settings to clear the cache.
Verify manual fetch button in the admin panel.
Ensure the fetch button correctly triggers fimn_fetch_market_news() and logs any errors.
Check database inserts for failures.
Add better debugging messages to track when and why news entries might not be stored.
Final Steps:
Test fetching news via AJAX.
Check logs for remaining errors.
Verify displayed news is up-to-date.
Confirm Discord and Mailchimp integration still work.
Deploy fixes and monitor performance.
Would you like a revised version of the plugin with these fixes already implemented? ðŸš€
