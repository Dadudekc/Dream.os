Devlog: Day 3
"How do you move fast without breaking the thing you’re building to last?"
Today was a light one...
Had to pick up extra hours at work and streamed late... energy wasn’t 100%, but still made it count.
Cleaned up the repo structure...
Renamed the local branch from main to master to align it with the remote.
Got the tracking setup right... master now properly tracks origin/master.
Pushed the latest modularization updates—tests, setup.py, project restructuring—all in.
Verified remote branch alignment. That part’s clean.
Test coverage? Sitting at 96% across the bots.
Finally feels like the systems are getting tight.
On the trading side...
First day back on the charts this year.
Closed out 41% on the $100 account—
…not starting from $91 like I thought.
It’s official now...
Winner for the year... but the restart just began.
We’re not blowing it this time.
Next...
— Clean up any lingering main branch refs
— Start testing the pipeline. Make sure sync and CI flow
— Keep refining the test suite
— Need to loop back on the LSTMModelTrainer merge, but that’s for tomorrow...
"Most people waste time trying to go faster...
Focus on removing what slows you down."
