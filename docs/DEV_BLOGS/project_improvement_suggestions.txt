Devlog Drop // Late Session Check-in
“Where is the real bottleneck... is it the code or me?”
That’s where my head’s been tonight. Sat down planning to tighten the plugin, ended up peeling back layers on the whole system. It’s been a grind... not just in the execution but mentally.
We did a full audit on how the trading data, automation, and content workflows are stacking up. And to be blunt... a lot of what’s slowing us down isn’t the tech. It’s me... still carrying too much of the weight manually. Debugging things that should be self-healing. Refactoring the same workflows when they should be modular and fire on their own.
Main takeaways from today:
The log viewer was misfiring because of a missing constant... fixed that.
Cache manager needed a cleanup... we rewired it to handle transient and persistent cache properly.
Started pushing toward a unified System Health Dashboard... that’s where we’ll really start shaving time off the process.
Content... realized I’ve been dragging my feet trying to dial in my voice manually every time. Time to build a Content OS so it runs clean.
The plugin’s modular now. The architecture’s starting to look like what I pictured... still rough, but the pieces are moving into place. Lot of mental energy went into breaking my old habits of “just get it working” and starting to move toward “build it once so you don’t have to touch it again.”
What’s next...
Dashboard wireframe first.
Get the data QA middleware drafted out.
Then I’m back to the content pipeline... getting that running clean before the week’s over.
No more patch jobs. Full convergence or nothing.
