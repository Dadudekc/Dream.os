“Where am I over-complicating things... and where am I under-building?”
That’s been sitting in my head all day.
Today was a system audit... deep dive on FreerideInvestor... where I’m bleeding time and energy, where things are messy. This project started as a plugin... and now it’s grown into something that needs to be enterprise-ready. But I’ve still got one foot in the old build... and the other trying to sprint into Azure, microservices, real-time alerts, AI orchestration.
That split? It’s costing me.
Talked through some of the hard truths:
The WordPress stack is a legacy anchor. It worked as a PoC, but keeping it alive while trying to scale Azure and serverless architecture is just noise.
I’m doing too much... execution, strategy, and system intelligence. And until I offload some of that cognitive load to AI and automation, I’m capping my own velocity.
What broke?
Not code. Not tech.
The problem was me playing architect and builder at the same time... slowing the system’s ability to self-organize.
Had to face that and cut the fat.
So... here’s what’s next:
Fully pivot off WordPress for core functions. React frontend + Azure Functions become the backbone.
Alerts go real-time with SignalR + Event Grid.
AI system controller gets architected this week... it’s going to start making decisions I don’t need to be in the middle of.
Content creation and distribution automated. Data to content to audience, without me touching every piece.
Centralize logs, observability... make this thing talk to me, not the other way around.
This isn’t about adding more... it’s about removing anything slowing the signal.
