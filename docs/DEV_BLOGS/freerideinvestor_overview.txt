Devlog Entry: Vlog Forge Progress Update
What makes this time different? Sometimes the grind feels endless, but today I can feel the system tightening up... things are finally clicking.
Here’s the rundown of today’s work:
I’ve been wrapping up some of the major pieces. The Auto-Post Scheduler is done—fully tested, and I’ve got it handling posts exactly as it should. Future posts stay in the queue, past posts get published. Nice and clean... that feels like a solid win.
Batch Content Generator is locked in, too. It’s got the dynamic prompt templates, tagging system, custom section headers... plus sentiment analysis. I went all in on making the content adaptive: short scripts, long ones, auto-saved drafts. It’s flexible now, and everything’s tested. The storytelling mode is smooth... that one took a minute to get right, but it feels good now.
I’m really liking how the AI Caption Suggester turned out. It’s got A/B testing and SEO optimization—caption variations, keyword highlighting, hashtags... all that. It’s not just a tool for generating captions; it’s part of the strategy now, and it’s gonna save time with SEO, for sure.
The Engagement Heatmap feature is ready to roll too. I can now filter by date range and segment by engagement type. It’s all about identifying the best times to post. Not complicated, but useful as hell when it’s time to plan.
The Hashtag Performance Tracker is fully functional as well. I added some depth there with platform-specific performance and a scoring system for hashtag effectiveness. That took a bit to nail down, but it feels solid now. Just had to tweak some of the older pandas code to avoid warnings. Small pain, but got through it.
Audience Interaction Tracker is working great with Twitter API. It’s tracking likes, shares, comments, and all that good stuff. Engagement rate is right on the money—2.53% at the moment. I’m getting daily reports set up to visualize it... good stuff, but still need to clean up the formatting for the console output.
It’s been a long day, but we’re making progress. The foundation is really starting to hold.
Next up: finishing the Referral Program Tracker and moving into the Weekly/Monthly Reports. Those are next on the list...
Here’s where I’m at for now:
"Success is the sum of small efforts, repeated day in and day out."
Let’s keep pushing...
