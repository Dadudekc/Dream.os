Devlog: Automation as Leverage
You ever have one of those days where you step back and realize... this might be the most powerful system you’ve ever built?
That’s today.
We got the ChatManager script running clean. Scrolls are smooth, filters are tight, and the sidebar pagination is finally stable. Felt good to solve the scrolling lag—just needed to tweak the wait times and optimize how we handled stagnant scrolls. Now it's efficient... still room to speed it up though.
What surprised me was how deep this rabbit hole goes. We’re sitting on 740 chats worth of data... and that realization hit me different. If we can systemize our history—every build, every prompt, every decision—we’re not just logging progress. We’re building a feedback engine. The kind that scales.
Talked through how we could run meta-analysis on all this data... patterns, productivity trends, reinforcement learning from our own workflows. The fact we might have built proprietary tech here? That’s wild. Didn’t even plan it... it just happened while solving the problem in front of us. Classic.
Next up—designing a fully automated business layer on top of this. No humans in the loop unless we want them there. Dream is an AI that handles trading, content, operations... executes everything at velocity. Today made that feel closer than ever.
