Devlog // Audit + Skill Tree Mapping
What’s the skill I’m actually working on right now?
Been sitting with that... not just the task at hand, but the underlying metaskill. Pattern I’m seeing is: I’m not just building systems or strategies, I’m rewiring how I manage attention and execution in real time.
Today was heavy on clarity. Ran a full system audit—trading, automation, content flow. Looked at where I’m losing energy, time, momentum.
Some stuff was obvious... others hit harder once it was all mapped out.
Here’s the breakdown:
What I Worked On
Deep system audit of my entire workflow
Pulled apart bottlenecks, redundancies, and inefficiencies
Mapped out the current skill tree... but not just projects—me, as a system
Focused on where energy and time are leaking and what needs immediate cleanup
What Broke (or Got Tricky)
Found out I’m overcomplicating reflection cycles... spending too much time thinking about optimizing instead of executing
Trading workflow still has manual pieces I haven’t let go of—alerts, journaling, scanning... slowing me down
Cognitive fatigue from shifting contexts too often—trading, writing, content, meta-reflection all stacked without clear lines
What’s Next
Automate trade alerts and journaling in-session
Collapse all workflows into a single source of truth
Time-box reflection cycles... non-negotiable
Parallelize content production—ideation, draft, publish, all moving without me bottlenecking every piece
Set up deep work blocks that don’t overlap... no more task bleed
Execute top 3 priorities in the next 14 days to hit convergence velocity
