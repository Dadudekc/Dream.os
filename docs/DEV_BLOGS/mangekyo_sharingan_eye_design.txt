Devlog Drop

"What’s actually slowing me down... and how much of it is self-inflicted?"
Took a step back today... deep audit of the system. Trading, automation, content loops—all of it. Wanted to find the friction points I’ve been ignoring because I’ve been too in it lately.
What surfaced?
Too much manual decision-making on the trading side. MACD curls still running clean, but I'm bottlenecking myself by double-checking things I should’ve already automated. Execution needs to be autonomous—no room for hesitation in this phase.
Codebases across projects are still running in parallel without a true unified brain. TradingRobotPlug, Focus Forge, FreeRide Investor... each has been solid on its own. But solid isn’t the goal. They’re not feeding into each other yet, and I’m wasting time managing them separately.
Content’s another loop I’ve been running manually. One post = one piece of content. That’s dead. AI’s got to spin every idea out into full-on distribution without me touching every step. Right now, it’s all too siloed.
What broke or got tricky?
Some of the eye design stuff stalled because I didn’t clarify the art direction early on. Feedback loops were messy. The concept was tight in my head... not so much in the brief. AI generated too much noise until I slowed down and got surgical with the instructions. Fixed it, but burned cycles I shouldn’t have.
What’s next?
— Building a Unified API Layer across all systems. Full system convergence.
— Autonomous RL-driven trade execution. MACD curls + self-learning = zero hesitation.
— AI-powered content flywheel: one input, infinite output.
— Self-healing automations. No more downtime, no more manual fixes.
— Engagement intelligence: AI tells me what to post next, not vibes.
That’s where we’re headed...
