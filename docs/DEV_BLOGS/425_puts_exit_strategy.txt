Ever ask yourself how many decisions you're actually making... versus how many you should have already made?
That’s where I was sitting this morning... micromanaging every candle move on TSLA puts, asking myself if I should exit... again... and again... and again.
Pulled back and ran an internal audit mid-trade. The system was lagging—reaction-based calls, repeating the same signal reads (RSI, MACD, Bollinger) every few minutes, waiting for confirmation when the chart already told me the move. It’s not that I didn’t know what to do... it’s that I hadn’t made the system do it for me.
What was working:
The read was clean. Bearish structure. Lower highs, lower lows, VWAP rejection.
Indicators aligned.
TSLA kept rolling off key levels like clockwork.
What broke:
Time and energy got diluted by over-monitoring.
Manual chart scans and re-analysis wasted cycles that should’ve been automated.
No decision matrix in place. No hard triggers. Just vibes and second-guessing.
What’s next:
Codify the trade rules. Entry. Exit. No gray zone.
Automate alerts on key levels and signals (VWAP cross, RSI breach, MACD momentum shifts).
Move from indicator-heavy to price-action first. Indicators are confirmation, not drivers.
Batch analysis into 15-minute windows unless alerts go off. No more candle-chasing.
This system needs to move faster than me. That’s the play.
And it starts now.
