How often do I let small errors slip through because I'm moving too fast?
Spent some time tracking down a bug in ai_model_manager.py. Pytest was flagging an IndentationError... simple, but it blocked a full chunk of tests. Seven errors... all pointing back to that one broken if statement on line 79. Just hanging there... waiting for a block that never came.
Fixed it by closing out the method properly. The _generate_with_model function was unfinished—no handling for OpenAI, Mistral, or DeepSeek. Dropped in the actual API call for OpenAI, tied it to GPT-4, and wired in placeholders for Mistral and DeepSeek. Those will get swapped with the real hooks later, but for now, the structure’s solid.
On the bright side... test collection is clean now. No more import errors cascading through the suite.
What’s next?
DeepSeek and Mistral integration. Right now, they’re stubs. I need them live and swapping in dynamically so the model manager actually has choices... not just OpenAI fallback.
Every time I rush... I lose time later. Slowing down a little here saved me hours.
