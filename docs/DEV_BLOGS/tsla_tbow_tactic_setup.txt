"Am I really tracking the moves that matter... or just logging activity?"
Solid work today... finally got around to tightening up my trade journal flow.
Been overdue.
Started with a deep dive into the recent TSLA trades. Ran through every entry and exit, pulled the P&L, and made sure the numbers were clean—fees included. There was a little back-and-forth... caught myself almost glossing over some plays, but I stepped back and cleaned it up. Accuracy over speed.
The calls and puts? Mixed bag. Quick scalps had potential, but a couple exits were early. Not mad about it—cutting fast has been protecting capital. Still, there's room to hold for more. Noticed the $4.30 sell was textbook.
Definitely need more of that.
Built out two HTML frameworks today...
One for trade analysis reports, the other for my daily plans. Kept them clean... modular... easy to plug new data into. There was a glitch pairing buys and sells with P&L calculations, but I worked through it. Rewrote parts of the matching logic and reran the numbers until they checked out. We're good now.
Finished it up by laying out a trading plan for TSLA tomorrow...
Bullish lean, but not blindly. Breakout level is $337.50. That’s the line. Below $335, I flip and scalp puts.
Holding the $450 call for now...
No FOMO...
Just execution.
Next up...
Want to automate more of this. Get the P&L calculations and journal entries triggered off my orders. Less manual, more flow.
