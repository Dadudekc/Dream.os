“What happens when the system is almost right... but not quite?”
Today was one of those days where I’m stuck between knowing exactly what I want—and not having the system give it to me without a fight...
I spent most of this session pushing on the image generation side. Trying to get an AI to pull something from my head without over-explaining it every time... It’s a drag when you have to spell out every detail over and over. Feels like wasted cycles... mental energy I could be using elsewhere.
The tricky part wasn’t the concept... the concept was clear. It was the back and forth. The iteration loops are way too long. I’m prompting, re-prompting, correcting. Multiply that by every workflow I touch—trading, automation, content generation—and it adds up fast. That’s energy I’m not getting back.
What’s obvious now is I need a unified ontology—something that holds my aesthetic, logic, and system preferences... and I need it baked into everything. AI, prompts, systems... It’s like I’m operating across scattered islands when I should be running a connected network. That’s the inefficiency. That’s where things are bleeding.
Next step...
Lock in the ontology.
Build a modular prompt engine so I’m not re-inventing the wheel every time I interact with the system.
Move closer to persistent AI feedback loops... where it learns me. Not the other way around.
Master dashboard... needs to happen sooner than later.
It’s not about making the system work... it’s about making the system learn.
Then we scale.
