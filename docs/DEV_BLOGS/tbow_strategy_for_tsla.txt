Devlog | 03.16.25 | TSLA Puts + Trailing Stop Strategy Build
How do you stay patient when you exit clean… but watch the move keep going without you?
That’s what hit me today.
I caught a solid trade on TSLA. Entered puts around $352, took profits at $349. Textbook. But then it dumped another $8... straight to $341 after I got out. Felt that one. Not from a loss—more from knowing I left meat on the bone. I made 37% on the day. Locked in +$271. And I’m done early. That’s the win. But watching that move keep bleeding out? It pressed on me.
So I did what I do after these moments... I broke it down. Built out a trailing stop strategy right after. If I’d trailed half the position, I would’ve doubled my profit. Simple as that.
Logged the whole thing into the Tbow repository... full Python implementation. It calculates different exit scenarios—full exit at first target, full exit at final target, and 50/50 partial exit with trailing stops. Ran the sims. No fluff. Data backed. Clear that trailing is the better move if I want to catch bigger pieces without giving back profits.
What’s next...
Refine this into my playbook. Add ATR-based dynamic trailing and integrate it into the auto-trader I’m building for the plug.
One trade at a time...
One system at a time.
