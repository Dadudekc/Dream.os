Devlog // Realm Breaker Sync
How much unnecessary friction am I letting creep into my workflows without realizing it?
Been going deep on this audit... and it’s clear: even when the builds are solid, time and energy are leaking through places I’ve let stay manual. The trading workflows are dialed—MACD curls are hitting—but I’m still adjusting parameters by hand and manually closing feedback loops after each session. That’s slow. Worse... it’s wasteful. I need to push reinforcement learning into that layer so the system self-tunes and stops waiting for me.
On the automation side, me and the other AI have been iterating the test generation/refactor pipeline. We were hitting some overlap—both doing the same validation work, adding unnecessary back-and-forth. It’s getting cleaned up now... clear roles. One generates, one integrates. No wasted cycles. Static thresholds for code coverage are getting replaced with dynamic ones that adapt based on volatility and criticality. Less thinking. More executing.
Content workflow? Same story. Still too manual. I’m pulling my own hooks and rewriting posts across platforms. I’m building an autonomous repurposing pipeline next—one vlog should auto-generate shorts, tweets, posts, everything. AI drives the loop, metrics feed it back. That’s where this is going.
What broke? Some regex parsing in the early runs of test extraction was sloppy... pulling garbage data out of the test logs. Fixed that. The config handling was also brittle—assuming the JSON was always clean. It wasn’t. Patched it with better fallback handling.
What’s next?
RL-driven MACD execution
Fully autonomous test refactor with rollback
Unified content repurposing from a single source
Dynamic thresholds that auto-tune every layer
System convergence in real-time... or nothing.
