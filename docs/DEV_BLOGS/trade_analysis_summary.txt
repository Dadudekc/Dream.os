Devlog // 03.16.25 // Why didn’t this system just work the first time?
Spent the day deep in trade analytics... trying to figure out why I didn’t make money last year. I ran a bunch of raw data analysis off my PDF statements—month by month—looking for the leaks. Confirmed a frustrating reality... breakeven. No obvious profit, no major losses, just a lot of churn. Trades that should’ve worked cancelling each other out.
But here’s the kicker... while parsing the data manually worked, I wanted to run it through the plugin I started building—FreeRideInvestor Trade Analyzer. That’s where things broke down.
The WordPress plugin wasn’t rendering the analysis properly. JSON parsing errors kept popping up. Dug into the project files... found a couple big issues.
Python wasn’t always outputting clean JSON. Added better validation and flushed outputs.
The regex for parsing Robinhood PDFs? Too brittle. It worked on a few lines... missed plenty of others. Tightened that up, but I still need more robust handling.
Flask URLs were hardcoded. That’s fine for a prototype, but not sustainable. Reworking it to pull dynamically from the WordPress instance.
AJAX lacked proper error handling, so when things broke... silence. Fixed that, added more debug logging.
And the database inserts... they were failing quietly when they shouldn’t have. Wrapped those in better error reporting.
What’s next?
I’m gonna get a clean round of uploads running through the system... PDFs and CSVs. Then polish up the chart visualizations and get the Flask API fully integrated. Need to stress-test it on more data after that.
Some builds go smooth. Some fight you the whole way... This one’s swinging back hard. But I’m not stopping.
