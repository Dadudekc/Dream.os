What’s the point of sorting tasks if they don’t actually move the needle? That’s what I kept thinking as I looked at the mess of priorities I’ve been dragging around...
Today was about clarity... stripping things back to what actually matters and fixing the flow.
I took the FreeRide Membership plugin task list and cleaned it up—sorted everything by priority and stage so I can focus on what’s high-impact first. No more clutter. Just a clear breakdown: what’s next and why. Switched it from messy notes to structured JSON... because, honestly, I’m tired of wasting time digging through noise.
Nothing fancy. Just ruthless execution.
What’s tricky about this stuff isn’t the data—it’s maintaining momentum when you’re in the weeds. But this kind of sorting helps me see the gaps faster... and close them.
Next... I’ll knock out the high-priority pieces: core files, user management, Stripe integration. I’m not overthinking it. Just shipping.
