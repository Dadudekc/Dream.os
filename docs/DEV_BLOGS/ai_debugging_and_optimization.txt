Devlog // 3.16.25
Question I’m sitting with:
Where am I bleeding energy on things that should already be automated?
Spent the last couple hours auditing everything I’ve built... Trading systems, AI libraries, content flows.
Honestly, it’s messy. There’s too much duplication, and I’m spreading my energy thin trying to keep multiple bots and codebases alive when they should’ve already been merged and streamlined. TradingRobotPlug is solid, but I’ve got UltimateOptionsTradingRobot, TBOWTactics, and a few other side builds pulling focus... They’re overlapping, not compounding.
Same thing on the AI side. TRPlugLibrary was supposed to be the universal backend—handling trade execution, AI models, data processing. Right now it’s fragmented across repos like machinelearningproject and self-evolving-ai. That’s a problem. If this thing isn’t centralized and modular, I’m wasting time on redundancy.
Content’s another bottleneck. Still doing too much by hand. I’ve got socialmediamanager sitting there, but it’s not running the show the way it should. Repurposing content, automating posts, tracking engagement... it all needs to be on autopilot. Right now, it’s not.
What broke / what’s tricky:
Fragmentation is killing my execution speed.
Bots aren’t learning fast enough—no real feedback loop on trading strategies yet.
No CI/CD pipeline, which means I’m still testing manually...
Content isn’t scaling without me in the loop. That’s gotta change.
What’s next:
Merge all the bots under TradingRobotPlug. Stocks, options, AI-strategies—modules, not separate repos.
Turn TRPlugLibrary into the single AI brain behind everything.
Automate trade journaling + backtest/live trade optimization.
CI/CD for auto-testing and deployment... no more manual updates.
Build AI-driven content loops—one post becomes ten pieces of content, distributed automatically.
