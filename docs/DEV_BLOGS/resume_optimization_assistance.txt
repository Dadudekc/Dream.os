"Where am I leaking energy in my systems... and why am I letting it happen?"
Spent time today stepping back... auditing where my time, focus, and execution are actually going.
It’s uncomfortable... but necessary.
There’s a pattern I’m seeing: I’m spreading energy across too many tools, platforms, and workflows. Projects are clean in isolation, but as a system... they aren’t converging. Trading systems here. Content pipelines there. Infrastructure kind of... everywhere. It’s bloated. Friction everywhere.
What stood out:
My trading pipelines aren’t fully automated. Still manually running backtests, tweaking strategies, and uploading changes. That’s a slow bleed on execution speed.
Content is too manual. Drafting, editing, pushing posts—shouldn’t be me doing all of it at this point. That’s time better spent designing new systems or refining strategy logic.
Hosting is scattered. Hostinger, AWS, Azure... too many environments, not enough focus. Each requires maintenance. It’s not scalable.
The real bottleneck... me.
I’m still in the loop doing things that AI or automations should be handling.
What’s next:
Centralize everything in Notion or Obsidian. Trading ideas, builds, content drops—all in one place. A Victor OS.
Automate trading strategy workflows—backtesting, deployment, logging—end-to-end. Airflow + MLflow is the move.
Consolidate hosting. Probably migrate fully to AWS, containerize with Docker/Kubernetes so I’m not babysitting servers.
AI-generate content drafts and automate posting. If the system’s feeding me insights, I should have AI feeding that back out as content.
Goal: Converge everything. Less manual. More compounding.
"Speed isn’t the goal... flow is."
