DEVLOG // SYSTEM AUDIT + NEXT BUILDS
Ever ask yourself how much of your system is really converging... and how much is just running in circles?
That’s where I’m at tonight. Did a deep dive audit—systems, workflows, trading edges, agent pipelines. Stripped it all down. Found a few hard truths.
A lot of what I’ve been building is fast... but siloed. Agents running in isolation. Trading bots doing their thing but without feedback loops tight enough to matter in real time. Content workflows still have too much human in the loop... especially post-production.
What broke?
Agent interoperability is lagging. No real collaboration between the agents yet.
Too many redundant functions in my AI patching tools (DeepSeekModel, OllamaModel, AIClient)... wasted cycles updating each one.
Trading strategy reinforcement is manual... losses aren’t feeding learning loops automatically.
Content distribution... not even close to automated virality yet.
What’s next?
Agent Mesh Network: Building out a planner + dispatcher. Agents need to invoke each other dynamically—no bottlenecks.
Unified Patch Pipeline: Merging DeepSeek, Ollama, and AIClient into one PatchOrchestrator. Clean it up, simplify.
Parallel Execution: Refactoring TestAutomationManager to run multiprocessing + async tasks.
RL Trading Bot: Time to automate strategy optimization... stable baselines or TensorForce.
Content Virality Engine: Whisper + GPT-4 pipeline for auto clips/blogs, pushing into a Grafana dashboard for real-time metrics.
Pace stays high. But there’s clarity now. The system is awake...
We’re moving from fast to fluid.
