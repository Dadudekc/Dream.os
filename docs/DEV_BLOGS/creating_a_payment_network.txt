Devlog: Consolidating Focus
What’s the real cost of jumping between short-term cash grabs and long-term systems?
I’ve been sitting with that.
Today was about stripping things down… getting clear on where my energy’s leaking. I realized I’ve been splitting attention across too many directions—trying to build sustainable automation and, at the same time, running quick-hit affiliate plays that don’t have a real future. Both pull from the same energy pool. That’s a problem.
So I started consolidating.
Built a simple PyQt6 GUI for blasting emails. Quick. Dirty. Gets the job done. Not proud of the method... but it’s functional. If I’m gonna run high-risk plays, they need to be fast and automated. No time for manual effort.
But the bigger insight today wasn’t the script... it was realizing I’m spending too much time piecing together tools without stepping back and designing the system. No more tool-chasing. Time to build backend-first, API-driven automations that can scale. Forget the front-end polish. Backend power... that’s the priority now.
Next up...
Draft the API layer for campaign control
Segregate workflows—short-term, high-risk in the morning... long-term, scalable in the afternoon
Build an autonomous loop for lead scraping, segmentation, and messaging
I’m not here to chase volume. I’m here to build something that runs without me.
