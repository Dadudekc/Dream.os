"Where is my time leaking... and what’s actually moving the needle?"
Been in the weeds today figuring out why some parts of this system feel clunky... like, why are simple things taking so long?
I ran a full audit on the workflows—trading, automation, content. The big takeaway... too much fragmentation. I’m touching too many things that should be automated or system-driven by now.
What I worked on:
Cleaned up the blog and Tbow Tactics layout. The grids were all over the place... got them aligned. Tactics are cube-shaped now, side by side—clean and tight.
Redesigned the Latest Articles section. More professional layout... less bloggy, more intentional.
Rebuilt the hero image and logo concepts. Realized I’ve been overcomplicating them. Kept it simple this round—minimalist workspace vibes that actually feel like FreeRideInvestor.
Broke down where time’s leaking... most of it’s in repeated tasks: content categorization, image generation, manual template edits. Dumb stuff, honestly.
What broke or was tricky:
The visual asset flow. DALL-E wasn’t hitting the theme until I stripped it down. Too much noise in earlier prompts.
PHP templates were getting messy. Realized I need to modularize the components. Right now, it’s too much hands-on.
Still no unified system for dev logs, trading insights, and journal reflections. I’m jumping between files and platforms.
What’s next:
Building out a unified schema for all content—dev logs, tactics, journals... everything. One structure, one pipeline.
Laying out a prompt library for visuals. No more on-the-fly prompts that waste cycles.
Automating content publishing and layout rendering. I’m thinking Notion + Zapier or just moving headless.
System convergence is the focus... less friction, more flow.
