Devlog Drop
“Where’s the real bottleneck—code, system, or me?”
Been deep in cleanup mode today. Rebuilding core systems that should’ve been converged a while ago… but I kept pushing it off because I thought “more features” would fix things. Spoiler—they didn’t.
Started tearing through the PatchManager. There were duplicated functions everywhere… retry logic, refinement methods, ranking—spread across like five agents. Took a step back and realized this thing was Frankenstein'd beyond recognition. So I made the call to consolidate it. One manager to handle generation, refinement, ranking… not ten.
Pulled in pieces from AIPatchUtils, DependencyReporter, AnalyticsManager, and the old AIPatchManager. Cleaned the imports. Cut redundancy. Made it lean. The new flow is tighter—generate, refine, deploy—all looped back into analytics. No more manual patch reviews. No more handholding. Either it passes tests or it rolls back. Simple.
The tricky part? Untangling the spaghetti logic without breaking dependencies. I underestimated how many places were relying on legacy methods… so, yeah… there was some cursing. Broke a couple things that’ll need to be smoothed later. But it’s moving.
The system audit was the gut punch I needed. Trading bots are running on too many rails. Backtest data isn't synced with live trades. Patching systems are fragmented. And the content pipeline… still too manual. It’s costing me speed and clarity.
Next up...
Finalize PatchManager X
Build out a unified analytics dashboard for everything—patches, trading, agent ops
Automate the content engine to spin up posts from these devlogs and trading reports
And get the trading bots into a continuous deployment flow
Systems need to run without me in the loop… that’s the point. Build it right now so I don’t have to rebuild it later.
