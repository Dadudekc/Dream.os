What’s the real bottleneck... the tech, or how much I’m babysitting it?
Been deep in the Robinhood integration today... hit a wall on authentication. The script's throwing 403s at login. Turns out, it’s stuck on SMS-based MFA. Manual code entry every time… slows everything down. Hard stop for any kind of autonomous flow.
I’ve been relying on Robinhood’s private API, which is feeling like a liability. No official support... no guarantees. I’m forcing the system to work through an unstable access point. That’s not scalable.
So—next steps on the trading stack:
Moving away from SMS MFA. I’m going to swap to TOTP wherever I can. Might need to rig a temporary workaround to automate SMS code pulls in the meantime... not ideal, but it keeps the flow alive.
Looking hard at diversifying broker APIs. Alpaca and IBKR are next. Robinhood was always a stopgap. Time to make it modular.
Pre-flight health checks are going in. If a script fails because of a missing token or an expired login, that’s on me for not catching it earlier.
Also spotted some redundant loops... doing the same validation across scripts without a shared check. That’s getting abstracted.
What broke was my patience with human-in-the-loop systems... I need to get out of the way so the thing can run itself.
What’s next is removing me from core workflows... one node at a time.
