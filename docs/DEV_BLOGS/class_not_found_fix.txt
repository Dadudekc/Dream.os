What’s the point of building when AI can do most of it faster?
That’s been sitting with me today... and it hit harder when I realized a lot of what I’m working on—someone could just craft some prompts and get 80% of the way there.
But here’s the thing... it’s not about what AI can do. It’s about what I can orchestrate. How I can use it better than anyone else.
That’s where I’m pivoting my head right now.
What I worked on:
Dialed in the idea that I need to stop thinking like a builder, and start thinking like an orchestrator.
Broke down how all my projects—TradingRobotPlug, FreeRide Investor, Focus Forge, Troop—are part of one system, not isolated tools. The AI system I’m building isn’t about a trading bot... it’s about decision velocity, across trading, execution, and content.
Focused on building my own AI prompt library—specific to my trading, my workflows. No generic stuff. This will be the backbone that powers everything else.
What broke / was tricky:
Tried running Ollama with Mistral:latest to build out a TSLA day trade plan, and it either hallucinated prices or gave me swing trade plans... which doesn’t help when I’m looking for precise intraday levels.
Realized a lot of the prompts I’ve been using are too general... if I want actionable trade plans, I need tight prompts, focused on pre-market high/low, VWAP zones, breakout triggers, and execution timing.
What’s next:
Refine my intraday prompt library for real-time trading setups. I need AI to give me clear long/short triggers, risk levels, and entry/exit windows... not philosophy.
Automate daily TSLA pre-market scans and end-of-day reviews. This loop has to tighten if I’m going to scale this.
Keep stacking my AI-powered execution workflows—I’m not building tools anymore... I’m building a system that runs at speed.
