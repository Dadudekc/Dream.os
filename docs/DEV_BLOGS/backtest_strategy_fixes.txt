Devlog: Fixing the Backtest Loop
You ever wonder how much precision it actually takes to make a system reliable... like, where the edge of progress really is?
Today was one of those days where I had to sit with that. The backtest engine was breaking in subtle ways... positions weren’t resetting cleanly after a SELL... equity calculations were drifting... and even when things looked right, they weren’t tight enough to trust. That’s the kind of stuff that makes or breaks automation at scale.
So I stripped it down.
Rebuilt the position handling... now after a SELL, it resets clean—no lingering states, no weird side effects.
Cleaned up exit prices and PnL recording... needed that to be exact, every time, no exceptions.
Added some deeper logs to track state step by step... gave me eyes where there weren’t any before.
Hard to explain how easy it is to let little inconsistencies slide... and how much they compound when you’re running hundreds of trades in a loop.
But it’s dialed now. Tests are cleaner, behavior matches what I’d expect in live trading conditions... and I’m finally seeing the system behave with the discipline it needs.
What’s next...
Moving toward AI-driven optimization—parameter tuning, smarter stop-loss handling, all of it. I don’t want to be manually tweaking this stuff in a month. The system needs to adapt on its own.
And I’m going to tighten up the backtest validation further... simulate more edge cases and get those automated checks in place so I can focus on building forward.
