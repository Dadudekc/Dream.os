Introspective Question:
How much of my system is still running on me... and how much should be running without me?
Been deep-diving today... trading, content workflows, automation—it's all showing cracks I can't ignore.
The trading side's messy right now. I’m catching myself manually validating setups way too often... burning time I don't have. I was biased bearish, market went bullish, and I didn't pivot fast enough. Emotional drag there, not gonna lie. Overheld positions. Thought I could make Friday a revenge day... market proved otherwise.
Content stuff? Same deal. Way too many loops where I'm redoing things I already solved. People asking for "match the theme" on HTML... again. That's on me for not locking in a component system. Gonna fix that.
Automation? Underpowered. I’m still the one triggering everything... AI isn't doing enough heavy lifting on the real-time bias checks or content queue. That stops here.
What broke
The biggest thing? Holding trades past the plan. And my execution flow is too manual. I lost money and time today. No sugarcoating that.
What’s next
Automating trade plan validators with live data triggers.
Locking in an Atomic Design system for content so there’s zero style drift.
Scheduling everything—Discord, site drops, etc.—straight through Airtable + APIs.
Building an AI assistant that calls me out when I’m veering emotional in trades.
And Thursday... I’m closing out the trades early. No debate.
