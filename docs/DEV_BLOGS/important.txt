"Where am I creating bottlenecks by holding the system back... and where can I step out of the way?"
Worked through a full audit of where time and energy are leaking across my builds... Trading Robot Plug, FreerideInvestor, all of it.
A few things became obvious...
I'm still at the center of too many decisions. Config edits, API keys, content generation, scheduling trades, scheduling posts... and when I'm in the middle of it all, velocity dies.
The systems are solid. The Trading Robot fetches, preprocesses, trains, and deploys. It runs.
The Social Media Manager I built can hit StockTwits, Twitter, LinkedIn, Discord, Instagram, Facebook, WordPress. It posts... it works.
But they're silos.
The trading side isn't informing the marketing side. The marketing isn't driving engagement that feeds back into the trading signals.
Two engines... running parallel. Not converging.
The audit showed me where I’m slowing it down:
Manual scheduling
Manual content creation
No unified intelligence layer
No self-healing infra... I'm still restarting things manually when they break
And no feedback loop between data streams
So, where do I step out of the way?
Next moves:
Build a unified data broker—Kafka or RabbitMQ. Get everything speaking the same language.
Spin up AI-driven content that reacts to my trades in real time. LLMs to write, post, and adjust without me.
Move config and secrets management out of flat files and into Vault or AWS Secrets Manager.
Spin up Kubernetes clusters... remove myself from deployment and scaling.
CI/CD for both systems. Push code... deploy. Simple.
Build an AI dashboard that feeds me insights... not data. I don’t need dashboards. I need directives.
The goal isn’t to run the machine.
The goal is to design the machine so it runs without me.
“Don’t move the mountain. Build the system that erodes it.”
