Devlog — 2025-03-16
Question I’m sitting with:
Where am I leaking time in places that should already be automated?
Been deep in refining the front end for the dev blog... the usual loop—layout tweaks, CSS passes, responsive testing. You know the drill. But about halfway through, it hit me: I’m still hand-tuning design components when they should already be modular... already automated... already self-correcting.
Pulled back and did a full audit mid-build.
The bottlenecks are pretty clear.
Too much manual iteration on UI stuff that should be living inside a component library. No single source of truth for design tokens. Still missing an AI system that can spit out clean, adaptive layouts on demand. I’m chewing up cycles where I should be allocating them toward the core—alpha generation, automation pipelines, execution.
So...
Refined the table of contents into button-style nav.
Cleaned up grid systems for both blog posts and the updates section.
Brought the design system in tighter... but still more to do.
The tricky part was keeping everything responsive without falling back into over-engineering.
Felt myself slipping into that trap more than once today.
What’s next:
Build out a modular component library (Tailwind style or custom).
Spin up an AI agent to handle CSS/UI generation... done manually for now, but that has to shift.
Rebalance focus—70% trading systems, 30% content.
The frontend is clean enough. Time to move.
