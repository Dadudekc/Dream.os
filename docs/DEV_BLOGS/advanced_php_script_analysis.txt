Devlog // 2025-02-09
Ever ask yourself if you're overbuilding something simple... or if you're laying the groundwork for something that needs to exist?
That's where I landed tonight.
Started out just tightening up the PHP Project Analyzer. Cleaned up the core script... added deep dives into classes, functions, constants, API calls. Thought I was just getting a better summary engine. But as I kept peeling it back, I realized this has legs. Big ones.
Laid down a clean roadmap for scaling it... modular design, async processing, REST APIs, AI query agents. It's all sketched out now. Felt obvious once it was on paper. Future-proof and meant to grow.
Then I flipped over to the Python version. Spun up analyzer.py from scratch—same concept, scoped for Python projects. Classes, functions, imports, constants, external API calls. It’s quick and clean... already outputting JSON and YAML summaries with zero fuss. Debug mode is in there too because I always forget what I broke when things get quiet.
Big realization: this isn’t about code summaries anymore. It’s about giving devs (including me) a way to ask their code what the hell is going on… and get answers fast.
Next up: I’m locking in the agent layer... and thinking through how to make this query-first. Natural language in, insights out. You should be able to talk to your codebase. That’s the play.
For now, time to close the laptop.
