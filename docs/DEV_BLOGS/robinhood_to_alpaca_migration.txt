"How much technical debt is too much before it starts pulling execution velocity backwards?"
Felt that one today...
Spent the last block cleaning up some legacy code that’s been dragging—mostly the old Robinhood integration. It’s been throwing errors in the test suite...
AttributeError: module 'trading_api_robinhood' has no attribute 'rh'
—because rh doesn’t exist anymore. I killed that dependency weeks ago but didn’t circle back to gut the tests properly. Classic.
I rebuilt CustomRobinhoodAPI with the missing methods (get_account, place_order) so the tests stop tripping over themselves... but honestly, this Robinhood stuff is living on borrowed time. Alpaca is where I’m going, full stop. The Robinhood API feels like dead weight.
Also spun up a new automated refactoring script—this one's running on Ollama with mistral::latest instead of GPT-4... way more cost-efficient. It crawls through modified Python files, creates timestamped backups, and pipes them through the model for cleanup. Added retries, parallel processing if I want to scale it up later. Ran tests on it—solid so far. I’ll let it rip overnight and see what shakes out.
Finished by merging the MarketData classes... cleaned up the API key handling so everything pulls from .env properly. That’s one less thing to babysit.
Next up—full migration to Alpaca on the trade execution side. Gonna refactor TbowTacticAgent to work with the new stack, cleanly.
