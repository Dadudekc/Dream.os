Devlog | System Audit Drop
"Where is my energy getting diluted... and why am I still letting it happen?"
Did a full audit on my systems tonight. I thought things were tight... but when you zoom out, the friction points are obvious.
Started with trading. The MACD curl strategy works, but it’s still too rigid. Market shifts are faster than the strategy adapts. No reinforcement learning in the loop yet—so every trade is relying on static thresholds. That’s a problem. I need dynamic tuning running in real time... not me tweaking parameters after the fact.
On the automation side, I’ve got agent roles overlapping everywhere. There’s too much duplication between AgentActor, CustomAgent, DebugAgent... they’re all solving similar tasks, but there’s no single orchestrator driving execution. That’s costing me speed. And file movement? Way too fragmented. Four scripts doing different versions of the same thing—moving files based on rules. It needs to be one system, one API.
Content... same deal. Right now, it’s one post, one output. That’s leaving reach on the table. I’m not repurposing devlogs into threads, shorts, or emails. No virality feedback loop either. I’m just shipping, not learning from what hits. Fixable... but it needs to get handled.
Next up:
Consolidate file movers into a single rule-based system.
Build out an AI Orchestrator to run task routing across agents.
Reinforcement learning on the MACD curls.
AI-driven content multiplier to repurpose automatically.
Virality analytics feeding back into what I create.
Systems are supposed to converge. Time to make them.
