What’s actually an A+ setup... and am I moving fast enough to catch it when it shows up?
That’s where my head’s been today.
Spent the morning breaking down TSLA’s bounce vs. breakdown potential. Thought I’d catch a clean bounce play off the $420 zone, but it wasn’t there. No clear support, no confirmation—just me squinting at charts trying to will it into an A+ setup. Waste of time. I already know better.
What showed up instead? Puts. The A+ was on the short side. Trend’s heavy... VWAP rejection, RSI dragging... no signs of strength. Sitting under VWAP and EMA21 the whole time. Should’ve zeroed in faster.
Here’s where the system’s breaking down for me...
Too much time validating setups manually.
Rechecking the same indicators instead of letting a system flag them for me.
Letting “feel” creep in when I should be running the playbook.
I ran an audit on the workflow and it’s clear—decision friction is killing my velocity. So I’m flipping that.
What’s next:
Build an AI-driven validator that calls A+ setups in real time... no more debating.
Pre-map strike zones for each play type... bounce, breakdown, breakout... and tie them to templates.
Codify emotional filters into a score... systematize “conviction” instead of chasing it.
Fast in, fast out. No second-guessing.
