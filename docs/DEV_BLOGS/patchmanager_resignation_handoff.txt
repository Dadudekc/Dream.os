Devlog // System Audit & Next Steps
“Where’s the friction?” That’s what I’ve been asking myself today... Where is the system bleeding time or energy that doesn’t need to be?
Been deep in the weeds of my architecture... mapping out all the agents, plugins, patch managers, and debug tools I’ve built up over the last few cycles. It’s a beast—but a fragmented one. I’m seeing overlaps everywhere. Multiple agents doing variations of the same thing... different patch managers trying to solve the same problem in parallel. Every time I think I’m moving faster, the sprawl slows it back down.
The audit called it out.
Hard.
No orchestration layer.
No clear hierarchy.
And way too many manual loops where AI should already be closing the gap.
What broke? Honestly... focus. Or more like, focus dilution. Systems were expanding without convergence. Now it’s a priority to fix that.
What’s next:
Building a Master Orchestrator to manage agent tasks, patch pipelines, and analytics—one brain running the machine.
Merging all the patch systems into a single AI-Powered Patch Engine. No more redundant flows.
Centralizing logs and feedback loops so AI can start reinforcing itself without me in the middle.
Automating content drops from system events—if a patch works, that should automatically kick out a devlog, blog post, or a tweet.
Hooking live trading data into analytics so my strategies start adjusting in real time without waiting on me.
It’s about closing the loops now. No more gaps.
