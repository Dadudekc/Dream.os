Devlog: Where’s the Drag Coming From?
Been asking myself that a lot lately...
Where’s the drag in the system? What’s slowing me down?
So... today was about clearing that up. Tightening the workflow.
I’ve been juggling too much manually—posting, editing, tracking trades, running Discord, writing... trying to sound like me in everything...
It’s been slowing things down.
What we did was take a hard look at the entire process...
What’s working, what’s wasting time, and what’s causing friction.
Trade journaling is now getting logged automatically. No more trying to remember what I did two hours ago.
I’ve set rules for “no trade” conditions—if it’s not a clean setup, I’m not touching it.
That’s cut the noise down... a lot.
Also, started building out a modular system for content—blocks I can reuse, instead of writing from scratch every time.
I’ve been overthinking my voice... and wasting time reworking things that were already fine. Not doing that anymore. If the idea is solid, it ships.
Discord onboarding is smoother now...
People coming in won’t have to wait around to figure out what’s next... they’ll know.
Next up is harvesting data from the Discord. If people are asking questions, that’s what we’re answering in future posts. Simple.
The loop’s getting tighter.
What’s next...
Stacking out the content pipeline.
Automating more of the pre-trade process.
Refining how the systems interact... so I’m only stepping in where I need to.
We’re getting there.
“The system becomes clear when you stop adding things that don’t matter.”
Let’s keep moving.
