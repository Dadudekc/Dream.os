What’s the trade-off between overbuilding flexibility and just locking in one solid system? Been thinking about that a lot today...
I went deep on modularizing the patching system—finally carved out an apply_fix.py module that’s strictly focused on applying, testing, and verifying fixes. It’s no longer tangled inside debugger_core or debugging_strategy. Way cleaner now. It can handle rollback, re-run tests, and log error signatures... all without bloating the core loop.
We also mapped out a structure for dynamic self-healing fixes. Think reusable, generic patches that can slot into any project and catch the low-hanging bugs. That’s going to be its own pipeline, but it’s starting to take shape.
One of the messier parts was the patch application itself. The patch command on Windows is still shaky... ran into a couple failures where files didn’t exist or the unified diff wasn’t clean. I’m thinking we’ll need a backup method—maybe directly editing AST nodes or running an internal diff parser instead of shelling out. Not settled on that yet.
Next up is full integration... getting apply_fix.py wired into the overnight cycle, and then expanding the pattern library for common bugs. After that, probably circling back to the UI layer—PyQt5 for now.
