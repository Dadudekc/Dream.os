What’s the real cost of trying to do everything yourself… even when you know better?
Ran the TSLA trades today without AI assist. Wanted to see if I could trust the read… stick to what I know. It worked—caught clean moves, read the momentum right, stuck to the plan. But the price? Energy. Focus. The mental load of having to do all of it manually when I know I’m building systems to carry that weight.
I missed the TBoW post this morning. Woke up at 8:16… just wasn’t enough time to get it out properly. No excuses. That’s a hole in the system. It’s manual when it should be automated. If I’m serious about scaling, that’s got to be handled. AI should be pushing that out whether I’m up or not.
Same story on the content side. Blog posts, streams, Discord updates—feels like I’m bouncing between tasks. Time fragments… energy dilutes. I’m getting the work done, but it’s not tight. Not yet.
So, here’s the play:
Automate the TBoW post first. 48-hour window to get it clean.
Bring back AI for execution monitoring on TSLA. Let it handle the trigger points so I can focus on higher-level calls.
AI drafts on the daily journal + blog. No more starting from zero.
Rebuild the feedback loop—trade outcomes, content hits, community pulse—all feeding back into one system.
Tighten up Twitch + Discord sync so the community gets looped in without me dragging the line.
Not trying to run on willpower… I’m building machines to carry the weight so I can stay sharp.
What’s next?
System convergence. Maximum execution velocity. No drag.
