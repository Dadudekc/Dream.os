“Where is my energy getting diluted... and what systems are leaking more than they’re compounding?”
That’s been running through my head all day.
I sat down and did a hard audit of the workflows—trading, automation, content—and there’s a common thread... too much manual handling, not enough system convergence.
What got worked on...
Cleaned up the CSS for the trading journal pages... made sure they align with the FreerideInvestor main styles, but stay modular. No global bleed.
Refactored _trading-journal-insights.css to fully leverage the variables system... it’s clean now. No redundant color calls.
Started planning the grid layout for the journal content—main sections, sidebar, clear flow. It’s practical... keeps it easy to read and builds toward the scalable system I’ve been after.
Audit flagged major time sinks:
Manual trade bias validation
Emotional capital spent managing risk
Rebuilding UI components every time
Laid out the next steps for tightening this up: AI Ops dashboard, automated trading bias validator, and a real atomic design system for content.
What broke... or was tricky...
I’m still context-switching too much...
The automation pipeline isn’t unified yet—trading ops, content generation, system tasks... they’re living in different tools. Not a big deal when I’m running on full energy. But when I’m tired? It drags.
The trading bias system isn’t deployed yet... I’m running it manually, which is draining.
And the MVPs... I keep prototyping but not pushing anything into production. That’s gotta change.
Noticing how much I’m caught in build mode instead of scale mode.
What’s next...
Build the AI Ops dashboard... Retool or Streamlit. 7 days.
Deploy the trading bias validator. 14 days.
Launch the atomic design system. Standardize components for content and dashboards. 14 days.
Automate the journal and devlog publishing workflow.
Document everything as I go... minimal context-switching.
The energy’s good... but I’m keeping it grounded.
Next three weeks are about execution speed and reducing decision fatigue.
Clean pipelines. Clean execution.
