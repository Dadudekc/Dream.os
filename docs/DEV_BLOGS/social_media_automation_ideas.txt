Question I’m sitting with: Am I overcomplicating what should be simple? Or underestimating what needs more control?
Been grinding on the Red-Green-Refactor loop... dialing in the system for the Ultimate Social Media Manager. It’s starting to click, but I ran headfirst into some bottlenecks—mostly around debugging.
I’ve been trying to automate the bug-fixing process through AI—this is the third time it’s failed to deliver. Every time it feels like I’m trying to give the AI more responsibility than it’s capable of handling... yet. Lesson here: AI is solid for analysis and diagnostics, but I still need to make the decisions. That’s where I’m at.
What did work today:
Built out and tested the Content Generator and Post Scheduler—AI-driven content generation is functional. It’s pulling topics, creating posts, and spitting out solid scheduling recommendations.
Finished an optimized Viral Analyzer... now detects common viral phrases and emojis. Clean, simple.
Locked in a process for strict Red-Green-Refactor Mode, with logs at every phase. No skipping steps. No assumptions.
What broke or got tricky:
The automated debugging sucked time. No more. Moving to AI diagnosis only, then manual fixes. It’s faster and keeps me in control.
Context switching between trading, automation, and content is still slowing things down. I need a unified execution system. That’s next.
What’s next:
Start building the Converged Execution System... everything feeding into one place. Trading signals trigger content. Content triggers engagement. Engagement loops back into trading insights.
Integrate a Real-Time Feedback Loop for content engagement... posts need to self-optimize based on data.
Tighten the Refactor Phase. Every refactor should show measurable performance gains.
