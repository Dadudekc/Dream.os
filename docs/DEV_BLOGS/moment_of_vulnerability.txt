Devlog // 013
How much time am I wasting on manual setup just because I haven’t automated the boring parts yet?
Spent most of today hammering out the setup flow for TradingRobotPlug2... the goal was simple: make the deployment process brainless. Just run it and let the infrastructure spin up. But it wasn’t as clean as I thought it’d be.
First wall I hit was with Azure’s subscription management... even after selecting the right subscription, az CLI kept throwing SubscriptionNotFound errors on certain resources. Turns out relying on az account set alone doesn’t cut it. Every single command needs the --subscription flag hardcoded unless you want it to silently fail halfway through a deploy. Annoying but fixable. I updated the patch scripts to include that flag on everything—VMs, storage accounts, MySQL, the works.
Second issue... manual work creeping in. Things like entering subscription IDs, resource names, locations... over and over. That’s dead weight. So I built user prompts into the patch script, but even that feels like a temp fix. I need to externalize all this into a config file and inject dynamically. Less thinking. Less typing. More deploying.
Also hit some validation stuff—admin usernames can’t have uppercase letters (thanks Azure)... image names need to be exact (no more UbuntuLTS, it’s Ubuntu2204 now). Had to refactor the defaults to clean up those deploy errors.
What’s next...
I need to eliminate all interactive authentication. Service Principals and scoped permissions are next up. After that, bootstrapping scripts to validate and prep the environment before I even try to deploy. Long-term, I’m pushing everything into Terraform or Bicep... bash is fine for now but this needs to scale and self-heal.
The real bottleneck isn’t Azure...
It’s me, babysitting things that should’ve been automated weeks ago.
