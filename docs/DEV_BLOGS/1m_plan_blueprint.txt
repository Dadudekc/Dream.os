How much of my time is building... and how much is just circling the same loop?
Been thinking about that a lot after stepping back today and looking at where things are actually moving... and where they're just cycling.
Here's where I'm at...
I did a deep audit on my whole system—trading, automation, content. Basically where the time, energy, and focus are bleeding out... and it’s a lot clearer now.
The biggest problem is everything’s fragmented. I’m coding... trading... putting things out there, but none of it is converging. Feels like I’m building solid components, but they aren’t connected to a system that feeds back into itself yet.
Also... I’m not putting enough into distribution. Yelling into the void. I don’t have a product that people can actually pick up and use yet. And the shyness thing... it’s real. Makes it harder to push things out in front of people, even if I know the work is solid.
What I broke down today is where I’m wasting cycles:
Building tools but not offering them anywhere. No lead magnets. No funnels.
Creating content with no real CTA... just drops with nowhere to go.
Manual everything. No automation in outreach, no scheduled posts.
Working solo without building feedback loops. No audience = no signals = no iteration.
What’s next...
Pick one product. Probably a trading signal service or bot. Something for small account traders.
Build a free offer to capture leads... PDF guide or tool.
Set up the funnel... WordPress + ConvertKit + Zapier.
Start posting consistently on Reddit and Twitter... 3x a week, focused on process and sharing useful stuff.
Automate the social posts so I’m not stuck in the weeds.
Document everything... GitHub, maybe YouTube if it feels right.
Clean up the code so I can outsource or collab later without it being a mess.
It’s all right there... just need to stop running loops and connect it up.
"Code is my hammer... but the system is what builds the house."
Onward.
