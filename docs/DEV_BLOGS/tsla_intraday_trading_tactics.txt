“Where am I still wasting time I can’t get back?”
That’s what’s sitting with me after today’s run-through.
Spent most of the session deep in trade execution and system flow... and it’s clear—there’s still too much manual work happening in spots I thought were tighter.
Here’s what I worked on:
TSLA trades off the open. I grabbed a $487.5 call early at $0.79, then scaled in three more at $0.34. Ended up selling the lot around $0.49. Managed risk tight, got out green. Net was about +$14.76. Not huge, but clean execution.
Reviewed the entries... I’m still getting caught putting in that first order manually. It works, but it’s slow. The whole open feels like I’m burning extra energy for something I could automate.
Ran a full audit on my workflow across trading, automation, and content. Saw the gaps... stuff I keep doing by hand that AI or scripting should be doing for me.
What was tricky...
The mental load on entries is heavier than it needs to be. I’m making sizing decisions in real time when they should be pre-calculated.
My content flow is sequential instead of parallel. I’m still prompting for graphics when I should have a few ready to go. Hashtags are an afterthought instead of systemized.
What’s next...
Automate my pre-market scan and first order at the open. No more guessing.
Build a dynamic position sizing engine. Clean, mechanical, no second-guessing.
Auto-journal my trades in real-time and set up AI briefs by 7:30 AM CST... get ahead of the noise.
Batch content templates and automate hashtags. Keep it flowing without stopping to think about it.
If I want this system to self-organize, I need to stop being the bottleneck...
