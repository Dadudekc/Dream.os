Devlog // Sniper System Audit + Build Flow
"What’s the point of a sniper system if the shots aren’t clean?"
That’s the question I kept circling back to today.
Been deep inside the system audit and reworking the Sniper Entry logic—trading side, automation, and content all tied up in the same bottleneck.
It’s convergence or chaos at this point... and I’m not here for chaos.
Worked on
Rebuilt the Pine Script for Sniper Entries... focusing on the MACD curl, not just the crossover. Needed to catch the momentum shift as it happens, not after.
Refined the entry logic... Bollinger Bands + RSI + MACD all aligned.
Started mapping how the VWAP and EMA8 are handling exits and trailing stops. Clean rules—no guessing.
Updated the WordPress front page to focus on the Sniper System. The messaging was too general. Tightened it up. The strategy is the story.
Ran a system audit... called out where time’s leaking. Too many manual loops... strategy tweaks, content revisions, even execution.
Outlined the signal → execution pipeline. Node.js sitting between Pine Script alerts and broker/Discord actions. No more middleman Victor.
What broke / was tricky
Pine Script logic kept drifting... strict filters killed signals, loosening them flooded trades. Needed balance.
The MACD curl detection... had to get surgical about how I measure slope and rate of change—made it work.
Realized the content system wasn’t aligned with the builds. eBook says one thing, website another. Not anymore.
What’s next
Finalize the Sniper System source doc. Lock the rules in.
Build the Python optimizer to iterate strategy parameters without me.
Spin up the Node.js signal execution layer—this is the backbone of the automation.
Drop the Sniper eBook as a proper CTA on the site... aligned with the builds, not fluff.
Weekly KPI reviews... system feeds system.
