Devlog: Where’s the Bottleneck?
Been asking myself that a lot today... Where’s the bottleneck? Not in a casual way—really staring at the system and trying to feel where things are getting jammed up... and why.
Spent most of today tearing through the Advanced Fintech Engine. The architecture’s solid… but too many layers were slowing execution. Redundancies everywhere. Too many API calls stacking on top of each other… lagging everything else downstream. Every second counts when you’re moving data between trading models and content generation—and we were bleeding time.
Rebuilt the data flow to run parallel fetches instead of serial requests. Huge difference already. Cleaned up the caching, too… no reason to pull the same data multiple times if it’s not stale. That freed up more bandwidth to focus on what matters—getting signals processed and predictions pushed out without unnecessary drag.
Mailchimp… yeah, that was an unexpected pain. The handler was spamming errors because keys weren’t properly passed through the system. Fixed the validation logic, added some failsafes so it retries instead of crashing out. Not sexy work… but necessary.
Also killed a few dead loops in the reinforcement learning process. We don’t need to be running those portfolio optimizations every hour if there’s no state change. It was just eating cycles. Now it’s event-driven—responding only when there’s something to respond to.
What’s next…
I need to clean up the prediction models and tighten the feedback loops between trading data and the content that gets published. The endgame is speed—real-time predictions, real-time insights, no fluff. Just execution.
“Slow is smooth… smooth is fast.”
Let’s keep moving.
