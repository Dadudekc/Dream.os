Devlog Drop
March 15, 2025
How much momentum am I leaving on the table by overthinking things that should already be automated...?
Got a lot of clarity today... mainly about where my workflows are bloated and slowing me down.
I've been jumping between trading setups, automation scripts, and narrative builds—and I realized the context switching is bleeding time and focus.
A couple things stood out:
I’m over-iterating narrative templates. Tightened them up, froze the core ones. Review cycles are now biweekly, not whenever I feel like tweaking.
Commit messages... too much time spent rewriting the same structure over and over. Automating that. AI handles it from now on.
The bots (Twitch, Discord) are solid, but I haven’t hooked them into the narrative or trading triggers. That’s the next integration—building a unified command layer to control everything from one interface.
Also, thinking through a feedback loop where hitting trading milestones auto-triggers creative outputs. Connects the systems. Keeps me in flow.
What broke:
Mostly mental loops. No major code issues today, just realizing the friction is in how I’m managing the systems... not the systems themselves.
Burned some cycles clarifying cross-domain workflows, but that’s handled now.
What’s next:
Build the unified command layer—one control point for everything.
Automate commit logs and narrative triggers based on trading events.
Get AI-driven monitoring running on the bots to cut out more manual checkpoints.
Faster cycles. Less drift.
"Momentum doesn’t come from speed. It comes from clarity."
