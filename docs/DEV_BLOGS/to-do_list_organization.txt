“Where am I spending effort on the wrong layer of the stack?”
Spent the day deep in testing workflows... mostly grinding through bottlenecks I should’ve cleared earlier. The models themselves aren’t the problem—it’s the structure around them that’s slowing me down.
Ran multiple pytest passes across the anomaly detection and deep anomaly modules... same issues popping up:
Shape mismatches
Contamination edge cases
Mock overcomplexity that doesn’t reflect real-world flow
And every time, I’m losing cycles on environment quirks. Scapy complaining about missing WinPcap... predictable but annoying.
The redundancy is what’s bugging me. Same functions getting rewritten in different places... tests duplicating logic instead of isolating it. The feedback loop’s not tight enough.
I started breaking that apart:
Pulled model training and prediction into clean utility layers
Adding validation schemas next so the data stops blowing up the pipeline
Dockerizing the test environment after this... no more “works on my machine” crap
Kicked off an MLflow pipeline build to clean up the rest of the model training mess
This week’s about killing noise... tightening loops... building in feedback systems that flag recurring issues before I have to think about them.
Next:
Ship the validation schema tonight
Refactor test fixtures tomorrow
Stand up the pipeline by end of week
Auto-doc generation right after
Clarity feels close. Time to clear the last of the fog.
