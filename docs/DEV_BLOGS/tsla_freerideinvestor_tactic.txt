Devlog: Where’s the Bottleneck?
Ever ask yourself... where’s the real bottleneck?
Not just in the system... but in you?
That’s where I’ve been today.
Worked on packaging the ChainOfThoughtReasoner into an API... turned it into a clean FastAPI service. Simple endpoint, takes a task, runs the whole reasoning chain... spits back an answer. Should’ve shipped it last week honestly... but here we are.
The tricky part wasn’t the code... it was me.
Holding trades too long. Letting bias creep in. Ignoring the system I built to protect me.
TSLA ripped to $470 while I held puts... after all the data told me to cut at $455.
That hit harder than it should’ve.
So I took the L... stepped back... coded.
Next up...
Refactor the Ollama CLI into an async API call. It’s slowing down the reasoning loop and I can’t have that. Also building out hard stop triggers on trades... automate the exits, take myself out of the equation. The point is to trust the system. I need to hold myself to that.
Momentum’s building... just need to get out of my own way.
