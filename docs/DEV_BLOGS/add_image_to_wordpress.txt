Devlog: Where’s the friction really coming from?
Been thinking a lot about energy leaks lately...
Where the system slows down, and why.
Not just time loss—but attention fragmentation...
This week was deep in the weeds on content workflows.
What I thought was a simple image drop turned into a whole cycle of back-and-forth… generating, adjusting, iterating. It was small, but it exposed something bigger…
The system’s still too manual. Too much double-work.
If I’m generating assets, uploading them, resizing… that’s time I’m not building strategy or automating deeper layers.
So I stepped back and mapped the choke points...
Where the process breaks…
Where decisions are getting delayed because I didn’t lock the design system first...
Where the same assets are being rebuilt instead of pulled from a vault.
Fixed some of it.
Built out a structure for asset prompts…
Started the asset vault for reusable banners, icons, etc.
Cleaned up the workflow to cut out redundant requests.
Also realized—trading data isn’t feeding content the way it should.
That’s next. I want strategy recaps, trading insights… all flowing straight into content with zero touch.
What’s next...
Automate trading log outputs into content
CMS automation—no more manual uploads
Tighten the prompt and asset system until it’s seamless
