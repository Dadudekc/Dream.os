What happens when you wire up too much too fast? You find out where the system breaks... and where it refuses to break, no matter how messy the wiring looks.
Spent the day deep in integration hell... pulling together the agents, the orchestrator, the dispatcher, and the UI. Got the AI Debugger project to boot without falling on its face. It’s loading agents, initializing registries, and even handling patch workflows in the FixForge UI.
Tightened up the imports—there were too many missing paths, broken references. Cleaned those up so TradingAgent, JournalAgent, and AgentDispatcher actually talk to each other. Got the orchestrator launching sessions without eating itself alive... though I did hit that solve_task() argument bug in TradingAgent. It was missing task_type. Fixed it, but it’s a reminder I need to slow down and double-check how these interfaces talk.
Also refactored the all_stubs.py file. Made sure the agent stubs and AI model placeholders don’t just pass silently... they now log everything they touch. Nothing fancy. Just making sure I see the flow when it happens. That’s the priority right now.
I’m seeing a pattern... system convergence is happening, but I’m fighting config drift and missing files (context_memory.json errors are popping up). Tomorrow’s move is to stabilize that memory layer and get automated test cycles running clean.
What's next...
Patch up the TradingAgent
Make sure the context memory doesn’t throw errors
E2E test a debugging loop from UI to patch to commit
Tighten the patch retry mechanism
Clean, repeat, stabilize.
