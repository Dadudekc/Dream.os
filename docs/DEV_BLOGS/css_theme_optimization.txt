Devlog: Cleaning the Signal
What’s the actual cost of fragmentation... not just in systems, but in headspace?
Been in the weeds the last few days cleaning up the CSS for the theme... It was bloated... inconsistent... things that should’ve been tight were dragging load and readability. Duplication in grid systems, variables all over the place, media queries inconsistent... All small on their own... but when you zoom out, that’s where the time and energy drain happens. So I stripped it back. Clean grid system. Consistent breakpoints. Unified variables. No more noise... just signal.
Then I audited the automation layers... and it hit me how many redundant systems I was still holding onto. Pulling data from multiple APIs doing the same thing... fragmenting trading logic between platforms... automating one side of content creation but leaving distribution semi-manual. It’s like trying to race with sandbags strapped to both legs.
What broke? Nothing catastrophic. Just exposed the inefficiencies that slow execution down in the moments when speed matters most. Realized my trading flow is still relying too much on polling APIs. Needs WebSocket integration... real-time or nothing. Content workflows need to link tighter to data pipelines... personalization should be automatic at this point.
What’s next?
Centralize.
Simplify.
And wire up the systems so they move as one... not scattered processes I have to keep dragging across the finish line.
Clearer, faster, sharper...
That’s where we’re heading.
