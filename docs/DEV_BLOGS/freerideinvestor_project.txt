Devlog: System Convergence and Cleanup
What’s the cost of complexity when you’re building something that’s supposed to move fast…?
Spent most of the day tightening things up. Had to step back and look at the mess—plugin logic leaking into theme files… redundant API calls in two different places… scattered migrations that had me manually patching tables. It was slow… and I could feel the system fighting itself. So I made the call to clean house.
Refactored the whole flow.
Themes are now just presentation—no logic bleeding through.
Plugins handle everything data… API calls, database management, AI stuff… all in one place.
The API Manager is the brain now… consolidated all the fetching, caching, and rate-limiting. No more duplicate functions floating around.
The database setup was clunky too… so I automated it. Plugin activation runs migrations automatically… no more SQL dumps or manual imports. That was a huge friction point I didn’t realize was draining time until I cleared it.
The biggest challenge?
Trying not to overthink every file. Decision fatigue was real today… but once I locked in the architecture, things started snapping into place.
Next up…
CLI tools to speed up testing and data generation.
Kick off CI/CD pipelines so I’m not hand-deploying stuff like it’s 2014.
Then… start scaling the data systems. The architecture’s clean now. Time to make it run.
“Speed is a byproduct of clarity.”
Let’s keep going.
