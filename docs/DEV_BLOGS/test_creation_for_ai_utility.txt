What’s the cost of moving fast if your foundation’s cracked?
Today was a cleanup job...
One of those sessions where you realize the tests aren’t just failing—they’re screaming at you.
Pytest was flagging a ton of SyntaxError: unterminated string literal issues.
I dug into it...
Turns out the problem wasn’t logic. It was the triple quotes everywhere in the test files—messy docstrings, inconsistent formatting, weird quote stacking. Sloppy. Not intentional, but it added up. I ran grep -rn '"""' tests/ to surface everything. Brutal wall of noise... but helpful.
I refactored the tests.
Rewrote the docstrings cleanly.
No fancy comments... just clarity.
Rebuilt the TestAgentBase file to match the current structure—tight, direct. Got rid of the clutter.
After that, circled back to pytest.
It ran smoother but still exposed a few dead files.
Found a ton of old, unnecessary scripts under _SRC FILES/—stuff I’d clearly outgrown. Deleted a whole batch. Git status showed me what was still lingering... and yeah, there was a lot.
Ended up staging everything and prepped a full commit...
Simple, clean message. Nothing overthought.
Pushed it.
Next up...
I want to focus on getting the rollback system and patch manager fully synced with the AI confidence scorer.
Right now, it’s fragmented.
Feels like the pieces are solid... but the cohesion isn’t there yet.
One system.
No waste.
That’s the mission.
"Slow down. Cut deeper."
