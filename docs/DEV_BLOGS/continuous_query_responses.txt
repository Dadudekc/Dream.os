Devlog // System Audit and Workflow Optimization
March 15, 2025
What’s the actual cost of friction in my systems... and how much of it have I been tolerating without realizing?
Did a deep dive today—ran a system audit focused on where time, energy, and momentum are leaking across trading, automation, and content ops. Not surface-level inefficiencies... the subtle, compounding kind that slows down execution without me noticing.
Here’s the breakdown...
What I worked on:
Mapped out bottlenecks in how I interact with AI and automation—too many manual control points, redundant confirmations, and context-switching.
Spotted areas where I'm constantly repeating instructions around tone, structure, and depth. It burns cognitive cycles that shouldn’t be burned.
Noticed my workflows rely too much on me giving permission for obvious next steps. The AI isn't anticipating actions the way it should.
What was tricky:
Realizing how much latent friction exists when systems don't run anticipatory logic.
The illusion of control—holding onto processes I should have delegated to AI agents weeks ago.
Balancing structure with flexibility... hard to design systems that stay modular but can run deep without me always directing.
What’s next:
Flip the switch on No-Break AI Sessions—I shouldn’t have to type “continue” ever again.
Codify Persistent Interaction Protocols (PIPs) so my AI stays in alignment without constant prompts.
Deploy modular agents to handle task trees in trading, automation triggers, and content flows—goal is to get more hands-off and focus on strategic plays.
Set up anticipatory task segmentation... so the system serves up next steps before I even ask.
Parallelize more processes—especially where backtesting, risk analysis, and content generation can run side by side.
This isn't about scaling for scale’s sake... it's about freeing myself to focus where it counts.
