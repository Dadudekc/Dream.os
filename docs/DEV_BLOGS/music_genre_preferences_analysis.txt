What’s the simplest way to spot the signal in the noise?
Quick one...
Worked through a logic breakdown on a simple bar graph question... helping clarify how to read data objectively instead of getting caught up in assumptions. It was basic, but it reminded me how easy it is to overcomplicate things when the answer is right there.
Trickiest part? Slowing down enough to actually see the obvious. The graph said it... boys downloaded more country than rock, but it’s easy to miss if you rush. Same with my builds—when I get tunnel vision, I miss the clean path.
Next—getting back into system audits later today. I want to map out where I’m overthinking stuff in my workflow the same way.
Sometimes it’s not about working harder... it’s about seeing clearer.
