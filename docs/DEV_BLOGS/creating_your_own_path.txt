What’s the point of building if it feels like no one’s noticing?
Been sitting with that today...
I’m grinding, stacking skills, building systems... but I still can’t land even a basic interview. Feels like I'm throwing rocks at a wall hoping something breaks through. It’s frustrating. Not because I think I’m owed something—but because the pace I’m working at should’ve opened some doors by now. And it hasn’t.
So I had to ask myself—am I chasing the wrong thing?
I don’t think I want a job, if I’m honest. What I want is freedom. Passive income. Systems that run without me having to micromanage them.
And if the job market isn’t giving me a lane... maybe it’s time to stop waiting for one. Build my own lane instead.
What came out of this:
Reframing the goal... it’s not about “starting a business” for the sake of it. It’s about creating a machine that works for me.
Leaning into the assets I already have—my MACD curl strategy, FreeRide Investor tools, custom GPTs. These are things I can package or scale.
Ideas on the table now:
Trading Bot as a Service
Freemium AI Trade Analyzer
Automated content funnels
Monetized GPT tools
No one’s coming to save me here. But I’ve got the tools. I just need to execute.
Next step... zone in on one stream and get it generating.
“You’ll never be ready. Build it anyway.”
