Question I’m sitting with: How much energy do I waste shifting gears without realizing it?
Built out a full framework for a Superpowered TTRPG tonight. Spent a couple hours deep in it... mapping powers, origins, and systems. It was fun. But stepping back, I realized how easy it is to drift...
Not just creatively, but mentally.
I’m still running into a bottleneck when I pivot between systems. There’s this friction—like I’m losing focus every time I shift from creative to analytical. And that lag? It costs time I don’t have.
Did a surgical audit on my workflows right after. Clear patterns:
I’m managing too much manually.
AI isn’t being delegated roles aggressively enough.
I’m not enforcing transitions between deep work states... they’re just happening, and it’s messy.
The TTRPG project itself? Solid groundwork... but without a pipeline to loop it back into my ecosystem (content, products, assets), it’s just sitting there.
What broke?
My energy flow. I’m wasting cycles shifting contexts without a protocol.
And I’m not anchoring creative work to my core systems in trading, automation, or content.
What’s next...
Assigning clear AI roles: Context Manager, KPI Synthesizer, Content Repurposer.
Designing a two-minute focus shift protocol so I can snap between modes clean.
Building a creative output tracker—TTRPG is first up to get modularized and monetized.
Time to tighten the loop... bring the pieces together faster... cleaner.
