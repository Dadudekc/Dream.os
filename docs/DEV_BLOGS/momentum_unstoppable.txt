Still shaking off the dust… but here we go.
Ever ask yourself how much energy gets wasted just switching between things?
That’s been on my mind all day.
Been deep auditing the system—trading, automation, content.
A lot of it works… but not as smooth as I thought.
Redundant processes, manual triggers everywhere, too much waiting on me to push buttons.
That’s friction.
That’s drag.
Trading is solid but narrow... LSTM-only.
Need more muscle there—probably bringing in Transformers, maybe even an ensemble approach.
Also... no real-time data feeds yet. That’s a hole.
Everything runs when I tell it to. Nothing runs when I don’t.
That’s not how I want to move.
Automation?
Still got duplicated logging setups. Fixed part of it by centralizing logging in utils.py...
but model loading and data handling still repeat too much.
No caching. No event-driven architecture yet.
Working on it.
Content...
Raw ideas, but no system turning them into multi-platform content.
Manually posting when I get the energy.
I need that automated—AI handling the repurposing, scheduling it around my milestones.
Too much brainpower wasted keeping all these plates spinning.
What’s next…
Real-time data feeds, probably with WebSocket or Kafka
Event-driven pipelines (Airflow or maybe serverless Lambda triggers)
AutoML or hyperparameter tuning to get better performance without babysitting it
Content pipeline that turns my drops into posts, videos, audio… on autopilot
One control plane to rule all of it... streamline the flow
Tired... but clear.
This is where it gets real.
“Speed follows clarity.”
