Devlog Entry:
How much time do we actually save by automating things... and what’s the cost of not optimizing?
Been deep into optimizing the API setup wizard. A lot of little tweaks today, but they add up. First off, I overhauled the script for collecting API keys—added some polish with color-coded output using colorama, and made the validation process smoother. It now retries a few times before giving up, and throws more detailed error messages when it breaks. Realized that catching issues like invalid keys early can save way more time in the long run...
Also cleaned up the .env file handling—was writing keys blindly before, now it's all clean and handled with python-dotenv. Feels a bit more solid.
And then there’s the big picture: the API Wizard project. Started drafting out a future plan for the whole suite—basically, laying out how everything fits together from here on out. It's all about creating a modular system where we can add APIs, wizards, and functionality as we go... scaling it without getting lost in the weeds. The automation’s key, but so is making the user experience smooth with real-time AI assistance. It's a tough balance—want to be smart with automation but not force the AI to do everything. There’s still room for human intervention when things get messy.
The SelfEvolver tests got a nice clean-up, too. Fixed the encoding issues, improved error handling... nothing glamorous, but it feels more solid now. Unit tests are more reliable, and we’re catching edge cases earlier.
What broke? Just the usual—getting the AI to offer consistent suggestions is still a challenge. The model needs to be on point, or it throws suggestions that don’t make much sense. But that’s just part of the process, right? Fine-tuning that part next... might take some time to get it flowing naturally.
Next steps? Gonna focus on adding more features to the wizard, starting with making it smarter when it runs into edge cases, and adding more API support. Also need to think about deployment soon—getting it production-ready is going to be a whole thing.
Anyway...
