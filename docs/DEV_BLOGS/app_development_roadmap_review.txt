Where is my time actually going... and how do I cut the noise?
Been sitting with that one today...
Juggling FreerideInvestor, TBOWTactics, and the Swift courses has been messier than it should be. The deeper I go, the more I’m seeing the same thing in different places—fractured workflows, redundant setups, time bleeding out of tasks that should already be automated or delegated...
Right now, I’m inside Azure...
I was on the portal earlier, moving through App Services, Quick Start Centers, Kubernetes tabs... trying to figure out where to drop in next without getting stuck in decision fatigue.
I realized I’m at the point where I don’t need more information—I need systems that execute.
What’s clear:
FreerideInvestor and TBOWTactics don’t need separate Azure setups. Consolidated the plan there... one cloud architecture, resource groups split by project, shared services.
I’m overbuilding in places. Some tasks just need to be outsourced. Content generation is the first cut—too much friction trying to design while I’m building APIs and managing cloud infrastructure.
CI/CD is non-negotiable now. GitHub Actions is getting deployed across both projects... clean pipelines, automated testing, no more manual deploys.
Swift learning stays focused... only working on the pieces that tie directly to app functionality. Everything else gets back-burnered or templated for now.
The bottlenecks have been time, divided focus, and unnecessary manual tasks.
Cutting those out.
Streamlining the workflows.
Every move from here needs to increase execution velocity.
