"What’s the one system I could build right now that unlocks everything else?"
I’ve been sitting with that today... and honestly, it keeps coming back to this Debug Agent. I was on the fence for a minute—whether pushing this thing to the finish line was the best move right now. Trading bots are right there, FreeRideInvestor is growing... but I had to get real with myself.
I’m a builder. I’m a dreamer. But the thing that slows me down most isn’t the ideas—it’s execution speed. It’s the time spent in the weeds debugging, getting every system tight before it can run on its own. That’s where the Debug Agent comes in.
Yesterday, we crushed 90 failed tests. I wasn’t even tracking how fast we were moving until I stopped and looked at the numbers. There’s only 50 left now... and after running it through my head over and over, it’s clear—we can knock that out in 3 hours or less.
This isn’t about whether it’s worth it... it’s about finishing what we started so everything else can run faster. This Debug Agent is the first real move to automate the part of my workflow that’s been slowing me down for years. Once it’s running in the background... I’m free to scale. Build. Execute at speed.
So today, that’s the focus. Lock in. Close the loop. Once it’s deployed, we pivot hard into the MACD Trading Bot and FreeRideInvestor automation. The goal’s the same—systems that run without me. But this one clears the runway.
What’s next:
Debug Agent wrapped and deployed today.
Trading Bot full send right after.
Scaling FreeRideInvestor premium offers while the bots handle the rest.
