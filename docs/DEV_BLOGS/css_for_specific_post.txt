Devlog Drop
Moonlighting... or Diluting?
How much time am I losing to micro-decisions that should already be solved?
That’s the question tonight...
Spent a chunk of time today reviewing a CSS file I already liked... debating if it needed tweaks, renaming it, figuring out where it fits in the folder structure... then second-guessing that.
It’s not a huge deal in the moment—but that’s the trap. Those little 5-10 minute pauses add up when they stack across content, trading, automation...
It’s drift. And drift is slow death when you’re trying to move fast.
What’s tricky is, I know the system needs to be more automated... but I’m still doing too much manually.
Naming files. Choosing folders. Deciding layouts. Reading and breaking down info that AI should be chewing through for me already.
It’s friction I can’t afford to keep tolerating.
What I’m working on next:
Codifying a full content deployment SOP
Setting up decision trees to eliminate these micro-decisions
Automating content digestion, especially devlog summaries
Moving styling into a CSS utility framework, so I’m not reinventing anything
Centralizing all design tokens so I’m not tweaking the same variables in five places
The faster I can offload these decisions, the more energy I can keep for building.
“Move fast... but never blindly.”
