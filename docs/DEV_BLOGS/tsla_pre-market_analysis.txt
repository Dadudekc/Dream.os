"How do you stay objective when the market’s throwing noise at you from every angle?"
Been sitting with that question while dialing in today’s TSLA intraday trade plan. The goal was simple—build a high-probability setup and stay mechanical, no bias, no narratives.
Pre-market had TSLA grinding under VWAP, volume light, RSI oversold. Not much of a story there... but the order book was showing a heavy bid wall at $386.40. Noticed MACD trying to curl but still under the signal line. Weak, but maybe a reversal spot if it flushed early.
Mapped out two setups:
VWAP rejection short off $387.80-$388.50. Clean trigger if it can’t reclaim VWAP, with stops just above $389. Targeted the liquidity shelf around $386.40 and a stretch down to $385.
Oversold bounce long if it cracked $386 clean and buyers absorbed. Same liquidity zone—tight stop under $385, profit targets back toward $387.50 or VWAP reclaim.
What was tricky? Timing. Expected volatility in the first 30 mins post-open... but TSLA’s been grinding slower lately, even on volume. Had to stay patient, watch for confirmation, not force it.
What’s next... I’ll keep refining the risk management piece. Locking in consistent 2:1 setups is fine, but I’m seeing room to improve how I handle fakeouts, especially around VWAP tests.
