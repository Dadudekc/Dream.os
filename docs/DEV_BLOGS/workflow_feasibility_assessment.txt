Can you really lead if you’re not willing to carry the weight?
Been working through a sprint plan for a contract idea my partner dropped on the table... Investor search automation, end-to-end. PitchBook API for the data... OpenAI API to make sense of it. Automated workflows. Feedback loops that learn. Scalable from day one. All the usual stuff I like building.
The question was simple—could I lead it and deliver in 4 weeks? Short answer: yeah. My systems and workflow are tight enough now that I can knock this out if I stay locked in. But if I’m leading, I’ve gotta be clear about what’s on me and what I need from my partner. That’s where I spent most of today’s energy...
Mapped out the sprints:
I’m handling architecture, core API integrations, feedback logic, and deployment.
He’s backing me up with handlers, unit tests, frontend (if we need it), and documentation.
Tight lanes... clear tasks. No confusion.
Tricky part is the feedback loops... not because it’s hard, but because if we don’t get clean data early, the whole thing drifts. I’ll need to stay on top of that.
Next up is drafting the doc clean so he knows exactly where we stand. No drift. No lag.
One brick at a time...
