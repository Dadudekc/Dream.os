Devlog — Morning Push
"How much of your time is spent moving things versus building things?"
That's the question that hit me today... and the answer wasn't great.
Most of this morning was cleaning up the repo. Renamed the local main branch back to master to stay consistent with the remote. It was a little messier than I wanted—tracking was out of sync, and I had to reset upstream branches manually. Pushed everything clean after that. Confirmed the branch is tracking the right remote, and the project structure is locked in.
The big thing that stood out was how much time gets eaten by manual Git work... branch renames, pushes, remote syncs... it's just overhead. Necessary, but overhead.
I also spotted redundancy in the folder structures... had both README.md and readme.md floating around (Windows doesn't care... GitHub does). Cleaned that up. Manual process again.
What’s tricky here is realizing that a lot of these tasks are things that should already be automated. They're mechanical. They slow down actual execution.
What's next is obvious...
Automate the Git workflows.
Get CI/CD pipelines online to handle testing and deployments without me pushing buttons.
Discord updates automated through webhooks and GPT templates. No more manual morning summaries unless I feel like adding a personal note.
The more this system runs itself, the faster I can move on builds that matter. Not bookkeeping.
