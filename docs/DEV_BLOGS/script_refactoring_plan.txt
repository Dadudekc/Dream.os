Devlog // System Audit Drop
What’s slowing you down isn’t always what’s broken… it’s what’s duplicated, scattered, or just plain wasting cycles.
Been digging deep into the agent ecosystem—DebugAgent, AutoFixManager, QuickFixManager, all of it. And yeah... there’s way too much fragmentation. Multiple agents doing overlapping work. Patch tracking duplicated in three places. I’m watching execution velocity stall because there’s no single system driving the fix loop end-to-end.
The DebugAgent runs tests. Then QuickFixManager jumps in to slap bandaids on failing code. PatchTrackingManager records patch history... but AIConfidenceManager also tracks success rates... and then AutoFixManager tries to patch again. It’s spaghetti, and it’s costing time. The loop’s redundant. The data’s fragmented. No central intelligence.
What broke? The feedback cycle. Data’s split, patch attempts get wasted, and debugging retries end up running blind because no one agent has the full picture. I’ve been running manual recovery where this should be automated.
Next...
I’m merging it all.
DebuggingOrchestrator is going to absorb all of it—unified patch management, confidence scoring, quick fixes, and rollback. One loop. No redundancy. Adaptive fixes only. The dispatcher’s getting an AI-driven prioritization layer too—tasks will queue up by priority, failure rate, and success probability. Full convergence.
And caching AI responses… that’s happening. No more recomputing the same query twice if it’s already been solved. Memory is leverage.
Immediate focus:
Merge debugging and patch tracking into DebuggingOrchestrator
Rip out redundant patch data management
Prioritize task dispatch dynamically
Convert quick fixes into adaptive fixes—static is dead
This isn’t about adding features. It’s about removing friction. Simplify the system, and the velocity solves itself.
