Devlog: Clearing the Noise
Ever wonder how much mental bandwidth gets drained by stuff you shouldn’t even be dealing with?
That’s what hit me today...
I was running some checks on the backend and noticed the logs were getting spammed—same deprecated warning over and over again. Nothing mission-critical, but enough noise to slow me down. It was one of those death-by-a-thousand-cuts situations... every time I looked, there it was, distracting me from the real work.
The problem was the old WP_User_Query using the who argument... WordPress deprecated that a while back, and it’s been lingering in the system like technical debt that never got prioritized. So I ripped it out, replaced it with capability instead. Cleaned it up across the board.
What made it tricky was realizing how often the query was running... no caching... no filters on non-critical logs... inefficient as hell. I set up Redis caching to handle that, and disabled unnecessary error displays in production. Logs still get written, but I’m not seeing them unless I need to.
There’s still more to do—some plugins and themes need a full audit... but clearing this out gives me breathing room. The system runs leaner now. Faster. Less noise... more signal.

Full code audit on the user management workflows
Dial in real-time monitoring and alerts so I’m not wasting time chasing non-issues
Keep scaling forward
