“What’s the actual cost of bottlenecks I let linger?”
Spent the day digging into the TradingRobotPlug project… looking for cracks, figuring out why things feel slower than they should.
I asked for a system audit, but the answers weren’t surprising—just things I’ve been putting off.
The biggest bottleneck?
Too much manual work where there should be automation.
Training models, testing predictions, spinning up Streamlit… I’m still running things in pieces when they should be handled through a single CLI or task runner.
That fragmentation is burning cycles I can’t afford anymore.
Logging was another one… realized I’ve duplicated logger setups across scripts. That’s stupid. Fixed in 10 mins if I sit down and centralize it.
Another thing—no CI/CD pipeline.
I’m manually testing every time I push.
Not scalable.
Not what TROOP needs if this thing’s ever going to be self-organizing.
So where are we now?
TradingRobotPlug’s machine learning flow is stable, but inefficient.
CLI interface is functional, but redundant.
Model lifecycle is too hands-on.
No orchestrator tying it together. Yet.
What’s next…
Build out a unified CLI with Typer or something lightweight.
Docker Compose to spin up the full environment—models, APIs, Streamlit.
CI pipeline to automate testing and deployment.
Look at MLflow or a lean custom registry to manage models. TROOP needs this.
This all folds back into the bigger goal: TROOP as a self-organizing system that runs without me babysitting it.
