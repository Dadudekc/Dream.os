Devlog // 003
What's actually slowing me down right now? Where am I diluting focus, thinking it's refinement... but it's really friction?
Spent way too much time today going back and forth on UI stuff...
Tweaking colors... reworking grids... checking contrast...
It felt necessary in the moment, but stepping back, I can see it’s not where my energy needs to be.
The bottleneck isn't design—it’s not having a system to handle the design for me.
What we worked through here was more of a systems diagnosis...
I’ve been too deep in manual loops—rewriting components, adjusting layouts from scratch, when I should be building a component library and automating the deployment pipeline.
No more one-off fixes... needs to be templates, patterns, and AI handling 80% of the heavy lifting.
The big takeaway:
I’m still acting as a one-man band when I should be building an orchestra.
I laid out a plan to lock in a Figma-based design system, codify the HTML/CSS components, and set up a content → deploy pipeline so I’m not manually pushing anything.
The blog needs to be on rails, leaving me free to focus on strategy and trading.
Automation isn’t optional... not if I want real execution velocity.
What’s next...
Design system first. Get the tokens and components locked.
Jamstack site pulling clean markdown.
CI/CD pipeline running updates with no manual deploys.
Once that’s running, I’ll loop back and audit the trading system for similar inefficiencies.
I already know there are cracks... just haven’t looked at them yet.
