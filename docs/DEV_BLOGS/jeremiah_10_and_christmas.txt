“What’s in a name... and who has the right to give it?”
Today’s rabbit hole wasn’t code... it was names. Identity. Origin points.
I was working through a question that’s been nagging at me—if Adam named everything, who named him? And who named God? Ended up in this deep dive through Genesis and Exodus. Found myself staring at Exodus 3:14, where God straight up names Himself: “I AM THAT I AM.” That hit different. A name that isn’t a name... just existence. Self-sufficient. No beginning... no one to name Him. That’s heavy.
Adam? God named him. Adam ties back to “adamah,” meaning ground or earth. The dude’s name was his function—formed from dust, named by the one who made him. And yeah... Adam names the rest. It’s authority, stewardship. A system hierarchy, in a way.
I kept looping on Christmas trees too... Jeremiah 10. People pull that verse out and say it’s about Christmas. On the surface, I get why—cutting trees, decorating with silver and gold, fastening them down. But context matters. That was about idols. Worship. Not festive lights and gift swaps. Unless the intent has shifted back to idolatry... which is its own conversation.
No builds today... but my headspace has been on frameworks. How we assign meaning, how we name the systems we create... or let them name us.
Next—back to the Focus Forge pipeline tomorrow. It’s time to push through that last piece of the task handler. Enough theory.
