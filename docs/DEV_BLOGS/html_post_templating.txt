What’s the difference between tweaking a system... and overcomplicating it?
That’s been the loop today. I spent hours working through the blog post template for FreeRideInvestor, trying to lock in a consistent style that I can use across all posts. The goal was simple: create a system that I can hand off to an LLM and trust it to keep the aesthetic on point—side borders, clean grid layouts, mobile-responsive, no guesswork.
But it wasn’t simple.
The side borders didn’t show up right. They either wrapped the whole section in a box when I just wanted a left border, or they disappeared completely. Turns out I’d been building off the wrong stylesheet half the time... so half the fixes weren’t landing because the foundation wasn’t what I thought it was.
Once I got clear on that, things started moving. I merged the cleaner header and nav structure with the updated grid layouts from the _my-trading-journey.css file. Brought back the side borders—simple, left-only, no full outlines. Same thing with the grid items. I wanted them to look clean, no noise, just that consistent left line that anchors the content without boxing it in.
Rebuilt one of the TSLA option reports in the new template and finally got a version that feels close to what I’m after. It’s modular now. Sections drop in clean, and I can swap out content without worrying about breaking the layout.
Still a few things to tighten up... mainly around how we handle mobile breakpoints. But it’s 90% there.
Next up... finalize this as a locked template. I need to be able to spin out posts like this without diving into the CSS every time.
