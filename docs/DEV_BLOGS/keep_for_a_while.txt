Devlog // System Audit Drop
What’s the real cost of holding on too tight?
Did a deep audit on my systems today—trading, automation, content. The through-line was pretty clear: I’m still gripping the wheel in places I shouldn’t be. Systems are built, but I’m slowing them down because I’m stuck in the loop… second-guessing signals, over-validating data, manually kicking off processes that should be firing without me.
The trading stack’s solid, but I’m wasting time running backtests on strategies that should be self-evolving. Manual oversight is draining execution speed. Automation scripts are siloed—each handling the same cleanup logic, the same triggers… zero cohesion. And content? Too many custom passes, not enough modularity. It’s eating cycles I can’t afford to lose.
The biggest friction point is fragmentation. Pipelines aren’t unified. Monitoring isn’t standardized. I’m everywhere and nowhere in these workflows. Cognitive load is high because I’m in too many loops that don’t need me anymore.
What broke:
The belief that I’m making things safer or sharper by staying hands-on. Reality check… I’m just slowing it down.
What’s next:
Centralized orchestration. No more scattered scripts. Prefect or Airflow goes in first.
Fully autonomous agents on strategy testing and trade execution. Zero human in the loop—just AI bounded by pre-defined risk parameters.
Modular templates for content. Plug-and-play blocks. Keep it clean, repeatable.
Unified data pipelines across everything. Trading, automation, content. One source of truth.
I need to trust the system more than I trust my instinct to check it.
