Devlog: Database is solid... now what?
How much time gets burned fixing stuff that should’ve been automatic from day one?
That’s been on my mind this whole build.
Got the backend locked in today... users table, portfolio table, data validation. Clean. No more duplicate entries slipping through. Tightened things up with unique constraints on the portfolio side. Added some admin tools to make debugging easier—copy-paste buttons, quick data pulls. Simple stuff that saves time when things get messy.
What broke?
Debugging was dragging... logs were noisy... everything felt slow until I added automation around it. Now it’s clearer where things stand, and I’m not spending hours poking at tables. Should’ve set that up earlier... lesson learned.
What’s next...
Live data feeds. Portfolio valuation in real time. Building out the first pieces of a risk engine.
The backend’s ready... it’s time to wire this thing into the market and see what breaks next.
