Devlog: Where’s the friction hiding?
That’s been the question today...
Where is time leaking... energy bleeding out... systems dragging instead of flying?
I went in deep on the audit—trading, automation, content.
Stripped it down... found the sticking points.
On the trading side... execution’s too reactive. Even if I’m fast, it’s not fast enough.
Manual triggers... delays between signal and action... that’s dead weight.
I’m moving to full automation with predictive AI handling decision flow.
Real-time data feeds... no more human bottlenecks.
Automation workflows were messier than I wanted to admit.
Too many steps... redundant triggers... conditionals that made sense when I set them up but don’t scale.
Cleaned a lot of that out.
Simplified the chains... modularized the processes... and started testing AI-driven triggers to handle dynamic scheduling.
Content was the last piece.
I’m still spending time repurposing manually... and editing by hand way too often.
Set up AI to handle first-pass generation and auto-repurpose across platforms.
Built a review loop to tighten it up without me needing to touch every piece.
What’s next...
I need better real-time feedback loops.
Dashboards... alerts... adaptive systems that self-optimize.
That’s the next pass.
Tighten the feedback... speed up iteration... and keep momentum.
