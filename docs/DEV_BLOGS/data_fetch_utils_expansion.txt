Devlog: Where’s the Real Bottleneck?
Been thinking about this all morning…
What’s really slowing the system down?
Not in theory. Not on paper.
But right here… in the workflows I touch every day.
This drop’s about the bottlenecks I finally confronted head-on today.
First, API dependency. Way too much of it. Pulling macro data from FRED, indicators from Twelve Data, sentiment from SocialSentiment.io… it’s all a drag. Slow calls. Rate limits. Too many points of failure.
So, we pushed caching. Set up a tighter ETL pipeline to automate the fetch… normalize it… keep it ready locally. No more waiting around for an API to hand us our data on its terms.
Next, local inference. Started wiring up an actual implementation. No more placeholders or mocks. Models running through ONNX or TensorFlow.js… triggering real predictions. Fast. Client-side where it makes sense. Server-side for heavy lifting.
There’s still a lot to do here. Optimizing the execution time… streamlining the call between PHP and the inference scripts… but we’re in motion.
Also rewired the error handling and logging. Centralized it.
It’s clean now. And it’s one less thing that can trip us up when we scale.
What broke?
The data calls are still noisy…
Some API data structures are just messy, and I’ll probably need to normalize deeper.
Model outputs aren’t standardized yet… so mapping back into the workflows is gonna be tedious until I clean that up.
But this is just grunt work at this point.
What’s next?
Full model versioning + A/B testing so we can swap models without breaking flow
More reinforcement learning hooks
Scaling the local inference so it’s seamless
Tighten the data pipelines with new sources—Reddit, Twitter sentiment, maybe even more alt signals
“Slow is smooth… smooth is fast.”
That’s the vibe right now. Keeping steady.
