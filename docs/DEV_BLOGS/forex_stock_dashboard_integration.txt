Devlog: Where’s the friction... and why am I letting it stay?
Spent the last chunk of time tearing into the guts of the plugin...
Not the fun parts—this was about clearing bottlenecks and cleaning up stuff I should’ve handled sooner.
Found out I had two versions of the same plugin folder sitting on the server.
One was the active build... the other was some backup copy I’d forgotten about.
Both were loading... functions clashing... causing fatal errors in production.
It was stupid, but it was costing time and focus. Killed the duplicate. Clean slate.
Then it hit me...
I’ve been letting a lot of redundant processes sit there.
Hourly cron jobs running whether or not they need to.
Multiple dashboards doing basically the same thing, just for different assets.
Separate UIs... separate code... wasting time every time I need to change something.
I’m consolidating everything now...
One dashboard.
One core system.
One set of modular components for both stocks and forex.
It’s already feeling lighter.
Next up...
Refactoring the plugin into something that can scale without me having to babysit it.
Namespacing, autoloading... cutting the noise.
And moving the alert system from hourly crons to event-driven triggers.
Might tie in AI-predictive checks down the line, but first I want the basics working clean.
One thing at a time...
But the energy’s shifting.
