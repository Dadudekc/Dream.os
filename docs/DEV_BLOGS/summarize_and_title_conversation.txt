Devlog // Did I trust the plan, or did I try to outsmart it?
Spent the morning deep in the trading cycle... had the Tbow Tactic mapped out—$400 resistance, $380 support, triggers dialed in, pre-market prep solid. I knew what I was supposed to do.
But when the move happened, I got greedy. I held longer than I was supposed to. I averaged up into a winning trade, which was fine... until it wasn’t. Saw +$400 at one point... ended the trade with +$27 after almost going -$900. That’s execution failure. No excuses.
This wasn’t about the market. It was me. Discipline broke. Plan wasn’t the problem—trust was. And when you trade small contracts in options, it’s all-in or all-out. No scaling. So every decision carries weight... and today, I made it heavy.
Took a hard audit on the system after...
Trading workflow: too manual. Too much in-the-moment decision fatigue.
Execution: needs to be pre-programmed, no live adjustments unless they’re already prepped.
Risk management: have to be religious about exits when I can’t scale out. Small wins > emotional holds.
Content + trade review flow: scattered. Needs to converge into one feedback loop that runs without me forcing it.
Built out a priority list for tightening it all up...
Pre-market report automated.
All-in, all-out rules codified for options.
Trade logs + post-mortems structured, AI assisted.
Content blocks built off the trades themselves. No extra bandwidth.
Live accountability triggers when I’m in a trade... no emotional freelancing.
System convergence is the goal. No wasted moves.
I’m not here to predict. I’m here to execute.
Tomorrow’s another chance to sharpen it.
"Discipline is the bridge between goals and execution."
