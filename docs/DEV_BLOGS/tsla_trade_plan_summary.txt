What bottlenecks are silently draining time and energy... and how fast can I eliminate them?
Spent the day dissecting my own systems—trading, automation, and content generation. It’s surgical at this point. The more precise I get, the more obvious the inefficiencies are.
The post-trade reviews? Clean, but slow... still doing too much by hand. Writing them out, then manually converting to HTML. It’s solid output, but the loop is too slow for the speed I want.
Signal generation and execution? Half-automated... I’m getting alerts, but decision grids and triggers are still semi-manual. That’s a drag on reaction time, and I can feel it in fast setups.
Content? Same problem. No modular components yet. Every review, every strategy post—built from scratch. Works for depth... kills scale.
So here’s the move...
Automate the trade journal first. Direct-to-database logging. Pull entry, exit, indicators—everything. Next, wire it into an AI draft system. If I can get a solid first draft of post-trade reviews on autopilot, I free up hours a week.
Then... real-time signal automation. TradingView alerts, broker API, OCO orders. No more decision fatigue mid-trade.
Content blocks are coming after that. Modular. Templated. One-click exports—HTML, newsletter, whatever I need.
Performance dashboards and reflection loops close the system... every trade feeding back data, highlighting weak points automatically.
What broke?
Nothing yet... but everything still runs on human energy. That’s the bottleneck. And it’s gotta go.
What’s next?
Week 1... automate the journaling.
Week 2... AI drafts and real-time signals.
Week 3... decision dashboards.
Then scale.
