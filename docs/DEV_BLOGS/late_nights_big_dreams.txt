"How much speed am I trading for stamina right now?"
Running on 3 hours of sleep again... probably pushing late into the night. This is the life I chose, but today I stepped back for a minute to audit how I’m moving through it.
Broke things down across trading, automation, and content builds. Spotted a few bottlenecks bleeding time and energy...
Cognitive load is higher than it needs to be. Running on fumes forces more decisions to get through basic stuff, which slows me down where I should be surgical.
Context switching is killing flow. Bouncing between trading calls, automation builds, and content threads with no clean transitions burns energy I need for execution.
Running reactive instead of systemized. Too much of me deciding on the fly instead of letting systems handle that so I can stay focused.
What’s next...
Locking in a sleep recovery protocol. Minimum 6-hour cores every 48, plus 20-min resets when needed.
Setting hard blocks for trading, builds, and content... no more overlap.
Deploying AI-driven task management to prioritize without me thinking about it.
Content gets modularized and automated. Drafts, edits, and posts move faster without draining me.
Micro-recovery between sprints—breathwork, movement, resets.
Feels surgical. Less chaos, more clarity. Not just moving fast... moving right.
