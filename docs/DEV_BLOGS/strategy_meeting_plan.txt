Am I giving too much energy to things that don't move the system forward?
That’s what hit me today.
I was about to take on this Reddit deal where I’d build the entire codebase for a chance at 25% of its future profits… no guarantee, no control. After thinking it through, it’s clear—this would’ve pulled me off-course. Time dilution. Energy fragmentation. It’s a pattern I’ve got to cut.
I sent the message. Respectful pass. No drama. Just moving on.
Then I ran a system audit on myself.
Too many manual decisions on stuff that shouldn’t even get my attention.
Still doing things manually in content—one post at a time, no repurposing, no auto-syndication.
And the trading systems? Still relying on human reaction. That’s a problem.
What’s next:
Hard filter for opportunities—either it fits the system or it doesn’t. Zero hesitation.
Build the content multiplication engine. One post becomes ten, on autopilot.
TradingRobotPlug needs to move into full autonomous execution with a feedback loop. No more waiting for me to click.
Lock down time blocks. I’m bouncing too much between tasks. It’s slowing me down.
The focus is clear. No more energy leaks.
