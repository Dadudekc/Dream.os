“What’s the right balance between scaling into a trade and overexposing yourself?”
That’s what I found myself asking by the end of today’s session...
Here’s the rundown.
I ran the Tbow Tactic on TSLA all morning—scalps, curls, and breakouts. Started scaling into the $405 calls from Friday, added to the position today when the opportunity lined up. It worked... but I was heavier than I should’ve been. Locked in $48 there after trimming most on scalps, and left one contract for the “dream” with a stop in profit. In hindsight, I probably didn’t need to go that hard on size. Noted for next time.
The cleanest trade was the TSLA $370 call. Entered at $3.35, sold at $5.35... no hesitation, no drama. Perfect execution, tight and disciplined. That’s the blueprint. +$200 booked.
Then I tried a $342.5 put—was against the trend, near the end of my session, and I felt it. It wasn’t there. Took the $45 loss fast and got out. Glad I did. TSLA was holding $360 support, and there wasn’t a reason to fight it. Walked away before I forced something.
All in, I finished +$403 on the day. Solid work, but more important... solid decisions.
Next up... keeping position size in check, especially on scalers. Stick to setups with conviction and leave the chop alone.
