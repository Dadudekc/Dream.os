Devlog: Cutting the Fat
Do I really need to do this manually... or am I just stuck in an old loop?
That’s the question that’s been in my head all day while I worked through this. Felt like I was carrying weight I didn’t have to carry… wasting energy on things that could be streamlined. So I went in, surgical.
Cleaned up the trading process first.
Risk management’s been too manual... tweaking stops, shifting targets on the fly… it adds up. I mapped out a better system where risk adjusts automatically based on predefined setups. MACD crossovers, VWAP positioning, EMA sentiment—it all clicks together. No more second-guessing… just clean triggers and exits.
Next was macro event tracking. I’ve been manually watching for PPI drops, ECB moves… and it’s dumb. Too slow. I need those triggers feeding directly into my system… so I scoped out an automated event alert system. It’s next on deck.
Content’s still been a time sink. Even with the structure I’ve built, I’ve been spending too much time rephrasing, polishing, turning raw info into posts. Today I laid out a tone-adaptive engine—one that reflects my voice without me rewriting everything. It’s not perfect yet… but it’s close.
The tricky part?
Making it all work together.
I’ve got systems… but they aren’t speaking the same language yet. That’s the next battle—tying trading, alerts, and content into one tight loop. No silos. Just flow.
What’s next…
Build the unified dashboard.
Integrate automated execution on trades.
Hook up the event alerts.
And finish the tone model so it writes while I move.
One less thing to carry.
