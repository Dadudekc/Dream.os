“Where am I leaking time in things that should already be automated?”
Today was about tightening the fundamentals...
Cloned a repo I needed—TBOWTactics—and got into the Models directory without much friction. But the fact that I’m still manually cloning, initializing Git, adding remotes, committing... it’s not a huge deal on a single run, but when you zoom out, that repetition adds up.
Time dilution. That’s what it is.
Started thinking about where my workflows are bloated. Trading, automation, content—it’s all moving, but not as fast or smooth as it could be. No AI-driven triggers yet. Still too many manual pushes, too many context switches.
What broke? Nothing technical... but the process itself is bottlenecked.
Too much human in the loop.
What’s next?
Automating the Git setup for all new repos.
Getting AI handling more of the repetitive commits and pushes.
Starting the CI/CD pipeline work.
Moving from batch automation to event-driven systems, especially on the trading side.
And pulling AI into content drafting... stop wasting energy on things an AI can frame out for me.
Every move needs to push toward convergence...
Every system tightening until it runs itself.
