Is this system really converging, or am I just adding more weight to something already heavy?
Took a step back today and ran a deep audit on the trading bot, the Robinhood journal, and the broader automation stack… and man, the bottlenecks are clearer now.
Most of the friction is coming from all these manual handoffs—MFA codes, re-auth loops, clunky data fetch cycles... too many points where I have to stop what I’m doing and babysit a process. That’s a problem. If I’m trying to automate my edge, I can’t be the one holding it up.
The structure right now is doing too much in a linear way. Single-threaded processes, no proper async, no event-driven orchestration. Feels like I’ve been building a machine that has to wait on itself.
Also… there’s duplication. Logging in one place, fetching in another, retry logic copied here and there. It works—but it’s messy. I can’t scale messy.
What broke? Nothing catastrophic... but the Robinhood options positions fetch choked hard. ‘Str’ object error because of poor type handling in the API response. A small thing, but it exposed how brittle the flow is when I’m relying on sequential tasks and blocking I/O. That’s not gonna fly as this grows.
What’s next:
Event-driven orchestration first (leaning Redis Pub/Sub). Everything needs to talk, but without waiting on each other.
Kill manual MFA. Either headless auth or something like Robocorp. I need true hands-free trading.
Async everything… especially fetches and trade executions.
Plug the journal data into a content generator. The journal’s rich already—there’s no excuse for me to be writing every recap by hand.
Build a risk engine that runs in real-time. No more after-the-fact P&L reviews. I want alerts mid-trade if something blows out risk parameters.
The aim is convergence… not complexity. Simple systems. Fast systems. Self-correcting systems.
