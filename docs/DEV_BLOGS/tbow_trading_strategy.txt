Devlog: Where’s the Bottleneck?
Been thinking about this a lot today…
Where’s the actual bottleneck?
Not the surface stuff… the real drag in the system that slows everything else down.
Turns out—it’s everywhere, just small enough to hide in plain sight.
Worked through a full audit of how I’m trading, building, and pushing content right now.
It’s messy.
Manual analysis, flipping between charts, building the TBOW post…
Drafting copy, posting to socials, logging everything.
Every piece works… but it’s not working together.
That’s where time gets eaten.
What broke?
The old process.
Or more like… I broke it on purpose.
Too many duplicated tasks... too much manual energy spent on things AI can handle.
It’s fine—because now I’m seeing exactly where to start cutting.
What’s next...
Build a real automation flow.
Not just one-off scripts—an actual pipeline that connects trading setups to posts to marketing.
AI writes the post, pushes to socials, tracks it.
Data comes in, AI suggests the next trade... and loops it.
Everything feeding back into itself.
That’s the move.
No more dragging the system…
Time to let it run.
