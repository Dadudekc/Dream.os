"How do I stay in execution when the architecture starts expanding faster than I can map it?"
Today was about shifting into a more focused build state... stripping out the noise, tightening the feedback loop, and locking in a TTDD flow that can keep up with the velocity I’m aiming for. Red-Green-Refactor on repeat... no detours.
The objective was clear—set up a system for rapid iteration and integration, with multi-layer validation baked in before anything even hits implementation. Priority was to get a minimal viable structure in place... something functional, scalable, and modular from the jump.
The tricky part was dialing in the balance between speed and robustness. Making sure the test environments stay isolated so each component gets stress-tested without cross-contamination... that slowed me down for a minute. But the framework is holding, and once the validations were tight, it clicked.
What’s next...
I’m mapping the next cycle to deliver a working, AI-tested codebase. Once it's ready, I’ll deploy on my end and see where it breaks. The goal is to scale it clean and fast... and keep the feedback loop sharp.
