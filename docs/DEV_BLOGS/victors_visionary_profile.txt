Devlog Entry — 03/14/2025
Question I’m sitting with today: Am I overbuilding the solution and delaying the win, or am I laying down necessary infrastructure?
Spent most of today deep in audit mode... breaking down where my time, energy, and focus are going. Had to get honest about the fact that I’m stuck between finishing TradingRobotPlug and upgrading the debugger to support it. Both need each other, and instead of closing the loop, I’ve been widening it.
The debugger’s solid on a component level—agents are in place, error detection is sharp, and the patch workflows are solid in isolation. What’s missing is convergence. It needs to move from "tools that work" to "system that runs."
Big realization: I’m holding back TradingRobotPlug’s release because I keep wanting to build better tools for it instead of shipping what’s already working. Scope creep. No one’s gonna pay for something that’s perfect if it never ships.
Social media automation is sitting in the same boat. It’s 70% there, but I’m waiting on finishing the full stack instead of using the part that works right now. That’s a loss... need to flip that.
What’s next...
Freeze scope on TradingRobotPlug to one working strategy (MACD curl + basic risk/reward logic) and push it to a beta.
Deploy Debugger v1 just to support TradingRobotPlug. No fancy refactor ops for other projects until this runs clean.
Get basic content automation rolling... 3 posts a week minimum. Start getting feedback in the system.
Manual trading? Cutting it cold. It’s leaking energy I need back in the build loop.
"Ship the tool. Fix it live. Build it better because they’re already using it."
