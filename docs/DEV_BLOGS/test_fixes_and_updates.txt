Devlog // Network Scanner Build
How do you know when you’re actually moving forward… and not just moving in circles?
Been wrestling with that question today. Took a hard look at where time and energy have been leaking out of the system. Turns out... it’s mostly context switching and manual stuff I should’ve killed off a while ago.
So here’s the rundown...
Finally cleaned up the AnomalyDetectionModel—locked down shape validation across the board. That was a major source of false assumptions in testing. Deep anomaly detection is holding now... autoencoders working as expected, error thresholds are tight. Tests are passing clean.
Pytest coverage hit 81%... but the bottleneck isn’t code right now—it’s workflow.
Spent too long doing things manually. Running tests by hand, writing LinkedIn posts from scratch, and pushing commits without any safeguards... broke flow way more than I realized. Sat down and mapped it out. Pulled together a list of optimizations... unified CLI for dev tasks, CI pipelines, and AI-generated content that stays synced with the actual build progress. No more fractured workflows. No more wasted effort.
The focus now is convergence... aligning the scanner as a modular, scalable tool—enterprise ready, cloud compatible. But the real priority?
Velocity. Removing friction.
The system needs to start building itself.
What’s next...
Build out the unified CLI
Set up pre-commit hooks for linting + auto-testing
Start the AI pipeline to auto-draft content from commits
Containerize the project for clean test environments
The work’s getting sharper.
