Devlog: Clarity in the Chaos
Ever wonder how much simpler things get when you just slow down... break it into steps... and actually see what’s in front of you?
That’s where I’m at today.
Spent time working through a pretty straightforward build with Code Copilot. Got it dialed in to focus on clean, efficient code—something that doesn’t just work, but makes sense at a glance. No skipping steps. No half-finished functions. The whole thing had to be full-bodied, from top to bottom.
The tricky part was holding the line on structure. It’s easy to cut corners when you’re moving fast, but speed without clarity is chaos. Took a breath... mapped it out... and let it breathe. Step-by-step. Function-by-function.
It worked.
Now the code’s cleaner, tighter. Feels good. Not perfect, but better. It’s always about getting better.
Next, I’m looking at dropping in some unit tests and maybe stress-testing how this thing holds up under edge cases. There’s room to push it further.
