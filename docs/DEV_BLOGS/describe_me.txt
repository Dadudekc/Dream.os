Devlog: System Audit and Convergence Mapping
Introspective question...
What’s the real cost of staying fragmented?
Took some time today to run a full system audit... trading, automation, content... everything I’m building. Felt overdue. I’ve been moving fast, but some of the edges are getting ragged, and I needed to step back and get clear on where energy is bleeding out.
What I found...
A lot of my trading flow is still heavier than it needs to be. Too many screens, too much hopping between tools, and still doing parts of the trade journaling by hand when it should’ve been automated a while ago. I’m noticing the lag when I’m making decisions—context switching is costing me.
Automation is solid in places but siloed... I’ve got bots doing specific tasks, but they’re not talking to each other yet. No orchestration layer pulling the strings. That’s slowing me down when I want to pivot or scale something fast.
Content’s where I’m burning time unnecessarily. Still too many manual steps between ideation and execution. I need AI picking up more of the slack on prep and post so I can stay focused on the actual message.
What’s next...
Build a unified dashboard to cut decision latency in my trading.
Deploy an orchestration layer—probably n8n—to get my automations synced and scalable.
Refactor all my scripts into reusable modules so I’m not rebuilding the same stuff over and over.
Automate trade journaling through my broker’s API. That one’s high on the list.
Set up an AI-driven content pipeline to clear up the creative bottlenecks.
This is about convergence... bringing all these systems into alignment so I’m not wasting time where I don’t need to.
