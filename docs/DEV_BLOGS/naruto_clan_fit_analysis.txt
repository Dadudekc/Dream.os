DEVLOG // 3.14.25
“Where’s my energy really going right now?”
Been sitting with that question after today... and it’s clear some of my systems are leaking time and focus. It’s subtle. But subtle is expensive when you’re aiming for precision.
Here’s the breakdown...
What got worked on:
Tore through the AI Debugger IDE I’ve been building. It’s real-time now... scans, catches errors, suggests fixes on the fly. Basically, it runs itself. No more stopping everything to debug manually.
At first, it was about building things. Now I’m more interested in building things that build things.
The next layer’s already in my head—vector memory, chain-of-thought reasoning, and full autonomy.
No more “tools.” Just systems that self-optimize.
What broke / What was tricky:
System audit showed me where I’m bleeding speed...
Manual strategy tweaks on the trading bots. Still doing too much review by hand when that should be handled by reinforcement learning.
Same thing on content... too many ideas getting bottlenecked at me. Need an AI pipeline that drafts and distributes without waiting for my green light every time.
And the tool stack is still too fragmented. Each system runs clean, but they’re not fully converged yet. Too much context switching.
What’s next:
Reinforcement learning into the bots. Adaptive strategies, no hand-holding.
AI-driven loss review so I’m not sitting there analyzing drawdowns manually.
Unified ops center—trading, content, debugging—same interface. No more bouncing between tools.
Automating the content brief pipeline off my trading logs. Let AI draft, I edit.
And proactive code monitoring... moving past debugging into prediction and prevention.
