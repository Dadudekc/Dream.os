Devlog: Where’s the Energy Getting Stuck?
Been thinking a lot about where energy leaks in the system...
How much time gets wasted micromanaging stuff I shouldn’t even be touching at this point.
The patterns are showing up everywhere—code, trading workflows, content cycles...
Too many manual loops slowing things down.
Today I took the PHP shortcode handler I built last week and stripped it back.
Refactored it into something cleaner... modular... but more importantly, something I won’t need to babysit.
It’s got caching now to cut back on repeat API calls...
Added dynamic sections so I can choose what gets rendered without rewriting code every time...
Hooked in a logger for better error handling without me having to hunt things down manually later.
It’s starting to feel more like a system that runs without me holding its hand.
What was tricky—
Realizing how much time I’ve been burning context switching between trading models... automation builds... content workflows.
They’re all connected, but they’re not talking to each other yet.
Still feels like I’m the middleman...
That’s gotta change.
What’s next—
I’m laying out a unified data layer.
One pipeline that moves data across everything—
Trading signals feed content.
Content feedback loops into strategy.
No more silos.
No more context switches.
Systems that run... and learn... without me.
