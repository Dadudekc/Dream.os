How do you make sure the smallest things—like import paths—don’t bottleneck the entire system?
Been deep-diving into dependency resolution today... not the fun, flashy stuff, but the grindy work that keeps things from breaking when we scale.
I reviewed the AgentDispatcher and AgentActor files. Cleaned up the import paths—turns out there were inconsistencies that would have triggered hard-to-catch bugs later on. AgentBase was being pulled from two different places... needed to be standardized to agents.utilities.AgentBase. Simple fix... but if we didn’t catch it now, we’d be chasing ghosts down the line.
Mocked out some testing since I don’t have the whole environment wired here... but logic’s tight. The dispatcher now properly validates agents before dispatching tasks, and we’re JSON-wrapping the responses consistently.
The next move is stitching everything together across files—making sure every piece is integrated, no loose ends. Then we can hit testing properly... and move forward with the DebuggerAgent’s task execution and tool utilization flow.
Nothing fancy today. Just clearing the path.
