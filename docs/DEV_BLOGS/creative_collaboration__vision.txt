“Where am I leaking the most energy?”
That’s been sitting in my head all day... and honestly, after breaking it down, it’s pretty clear.
I’ve been splitting my focus way too much. Twitch, Discord, coding, day trading, AI builds... all running in parallel but not converging the way I need them to. It’s not even the workload—it’s the fragmentation. Too much context switching, not enough deep work.
Spent time today analyzing my workflows... realized the biggest bottleneck isn’t the tools or the skills—it’s me not having a single, centralized system to manage everything. No single source of truth. I’m holding too much in my head and in too many random chats.
Also... caught myself looping through validation cycles. Jumping into streams, flexing points, lurking, making sure I’m seen... and for what? It’s a distraction from execution. If I’m honest, that’s energy I need to pull back and redirect.
What’s tricky is balancing networking with getting sh*t done. I get why I’m doing it—but it’s time to tighten it up.
Next steps...
— Build the SSOT (Notion workspace starts today... everything funnels there). — Define core roles for the crew (trading, AI R&D, content/documentation, community lead). — Lock in dedicated “office hours” for Twitch/Discord... no more open loops. — Set up an AI-first workflow for coding and trading. No more scattered LeetCode grinds. Targeted, structured progression only. — Build the content loop. One input, multi-output. Efficient. Clean.
I’m done leaking energy on things that don’t move this forward.
