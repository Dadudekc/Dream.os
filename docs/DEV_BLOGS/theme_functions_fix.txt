Devlog // System Audit + CSS Refactor
"Where is my energy getting diluted... and how do I tighten the loop?"
That’s been the core question running through all of this. Today's audit made it obvious—I’m spending too much time context switching between high-leverage system builds and low-leverage frontend styling. I’ve been deep in CSS layouts, grid systems, post-specific styles... it’s clean, but it’s eating time that should be scaling out systems or trading workflows.
What worked:
We built out a conditional post-specific CSS pipeline. It’s flexible... lets me drop custom styles into posts without bloating the theme.
Cleaned up the REST API endpoint for the trade journal. Still solid.
Tightened the Discord invite cron jobs. Feels reliable now.
What broke / what’s tricky:
CSS got messy fast... tweaking grid templates and container queries across multiple breakpoints took way longer than it should.
The cards aren’t rendering the way I want yet—alignment and consistent sizing need work.
Doing these kinds of frontend iterations in WordPress feels sluggish. I’m repeating work because I haven’t systemized the component layer.
What’s next:
Shift the entire design system to Tailwind or ShadCN. No more custom CSS for basic components.
Automate the trade journal insight loop. AI pulls the data... pushes analysis back into Discord.
Tighten the CI/CD pipelines so I can get out of manual deploys.
The bigger lesson... I need to stop building at ground level when I should be architecting from above.
Systems. Then speed.
