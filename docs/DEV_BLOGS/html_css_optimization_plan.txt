"Where is my time and energy leaking... and what’s the fastest way to seal it?"
Been sitting with that question today... did a full system audit on my workflows—trading, content, automation. Honestly, I’m bleeding focus in places I shouldn’t be.
Here’s what shook out:
What I worked on:
Broke down where I’m spending time. The answer? Too much on stuff that doesn’t move the needle.
Manual trade journaling.
Micro-tweaks to content structure (HTML, CSS) when I should be batching and automating.
Daily content posting instead of building a 30-day pipeline.
Community stuff I could’ve offloaded to bots weeks ago.
Got clear on one thing: I need a Central Command Dashboard... one spot where trades, content, and community metrics live. If it’s not in front of me, it doesn’t exist.
What was tricky:
The realization that I’m still acting like an operator in places where I should be designing systems.
It’s hard to let go of the day-to-day when you’re used to grinding everything out yourself... but that’s slowing the whole thing down.
Also, friction around monetization testing—haven’t set up proper A/B pipelines yet, so I’m guessing more than I should be.
What’s next:
Building the dashboard (Notion or Airtable as a base for now).
Automating trade journaling and tagging, with AI analysis feeding back into strategy updates.
Automating content batching and distribution—TikTok, IG, YT Shorts.
Discord onboarding flow is getting handed off to bots.
Monetization A/B testing gets automated... no more guesswork.
This next sprint is about stripping friction.
Velocity over everything.
