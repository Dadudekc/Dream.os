"How do you know when something’s finally tight enough to trust—or when you’re just forcing it because you want it to be done?"
Been deep in MACD Curl strategy implementation today... wanted to get this thing clean enough to run in BasicBot without me second-guessing it every time it fires.
The core’s there now:
MACD Histogram Curl logic, tested and working
Clean trend confirmation off the 50 SMA
Entry/exit logic with basic stop-loss and take-profit rules
We ran red-green-refactor mode, wrote the tests, made sure everything passes. No skipped corners on that.
But here’s the thing…
The deeper I got into it, the more I saw we’re leaving money on the table by ignoring price action. Engulfing candles, hammer setups—they’re screaming at us in these curl spots, and I wasn’t listening.
So next phase...
I’m wiring in candlestick pattern confirmation.
Bullish Engulfing + MACD Curl? That’s a different level of signal quality.
Same with ATR-based stop loss instead of these flat percentages I’ve been lazy about. Adaptive risk. Smarter exits.
Also clocked a big inefficiency in how I’m testing these strategies...
Right now I’m hand-coding each one into its own testing setup. Dumb.
I’m gonna build a universal strategy tester—drop in any logic, get the results, optimize on the fly. That’s the move.
What’s next:
Candlestick confirmations (Engulfing, Hammer, maybe some Doji work)
ATR stop loss + dynamic take profit
Start mapping out the universal tester and plug-in system
Long-term... reinforcement learning for auto-optimizing strategy parameters. But first things first.
