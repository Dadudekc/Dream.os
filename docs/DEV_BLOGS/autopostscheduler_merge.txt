Devlog: How Do You Keep Track of the Right Data?
Been grinding through integrating the hashtag performance tracking today...
I started off by building the HashtagPerformanceTracker class. It's meant to pull, analyze, and process hashtag data from different platforms—Twitter, Instagram, YouTube—into a single source of truth. All about consolidating that data and making it actionable... from platform performance to engagement effectiveness scores. Pretty solid stuff. It's the foundation for what I need to push forward with social media analytics in my workflow.
But here's the tricky part... validating the data. I spent a good chunk of time debugging the validation logic for API keys. It wasn’t until I added automatic verification for API keys (you know, checking them right when they’re entered) that things really started falling into place. Before, I was just saving whatever was input, but now it’s validated first. I don’t want to be stuck with bad keys running in the background. That process was a bit of a pain, but it’s done now.
Then I shifted focus to automating the API key setup process. The goal was to make it as seamless as possible for anyone who has to go through the tedious API registration and token generation steps. Now, the script guides the user through the process, opens the API portals for them, and does some light validation before saving the keys. It's not 100% automatic—can't bypass registration—but the repetitive stuff is automated.
Now that the heavy lifting is done, the next step is to add token refresh automation—so we’re not manually updating anything in the future. Instagram and other platforms that use OAuth need that. After that, I’m thinking of integrating a scheduler for pulling the data on a regular basis. It’s all about building an automated flow that doesn’t need my constant attention...
One step closer to systemizing the social media analysis process. It's all about finding ways to work smarter, not harder...
