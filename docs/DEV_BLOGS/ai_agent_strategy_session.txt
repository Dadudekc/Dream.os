Devlog | 03.16.25 | AI Agent Brainstorm (w/ Aria)
What makes a system feel alive... and how do you design that without overcomplicating it?
Spent some time today kicking off a brainstorm session around building a unified AI Agent class. The goal is to create a streamlined framework that Aria and I can both interact with—something simple enough to adapt on the fly but powerful enough to manage real tasks. We’re thinking personal assistant first... something that handles task tracking, sends reminders, suggests next actions. Core stuff that increases velocity without adding noise.
The tricky part right now is making sure the workflow fits both of us. Aria’s mind works different from mine—she’s methodical, takes her time. I want to make sure she feels comfortable contributing her ideas without pressure. So we’re alternating input... letting her write thoughts ahead of time or speak when she’s ready. Feels right.
What’s next... start mapping out the architecture for this Agent. Keep it lightweight. Keep it flexible. Build the first version that can just handle task queues and priority sorting.
One piece at a time...
