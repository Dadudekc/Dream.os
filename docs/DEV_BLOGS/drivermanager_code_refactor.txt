Devlog: Tightening the Loops
How much time am I leaking in places I’m not even looking at?
That was the question today.
I spent a chunk of time digging through logs... ResponseHandler cycles, RL feedback loops, prompt handling. At first glance, it looked solid—responses stabilizing, reinforcement learning kicking in, entries getting logged clean. But when I slowed it down... watched the flow... there were drags.
Prompt sends are still too slow. Character-by-character input makes sense when you’re worried about detection... but it’s overkill when we’re operating in trusted environments. That delay compounds. Same thing with the polling for response stability—it’s set to a fixed interval, but the AI’s output speed varies. Sometimes we’re waiting just because the system isn’t paying attention in the right way.
Also... I’m duplicating effort on driver management across different scripts. That’s maintenance overhead I don’t need.
So I mapped it.
What’s redundant?
What’s leaking time?
What’s making me think twice when I should already be moving on?
Here’s where I landed...
What worked:
ResponseHandler logs are tight. RL Trainer feedback is consistently firing.
Entries are getting saved with clear structure—no gaps in the capture cycle.
What broke or was tricky:
Latency on prompt entry and response stabilization is slowing the pipeline.
Driver setup is fragmented. Wasting cycles reinitializing what should be persistent.
Logging is too verbose. It’s noise, not signal.
What’s next:
Move to direct DOM injection for prompt sends... keep the human-like delay only when necessary.
Adaptive polling tied to actual response events, not blind waits.
Centralize driver management. One handler, one lifecycle.
Tighten logs... less chatter, more clarity.
Momentum’s good. Energy’s steady. Just tightening the loops so nothing slows down the flow.
