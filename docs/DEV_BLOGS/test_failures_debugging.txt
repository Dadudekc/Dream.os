Devlog // Deep Refactor Scan + System Audit
How much unnecessary friction am I still tolerating in my workflows... and how fast can I eliminate it?
Been deep in system cleanup and refactoring cycles today. The auto-refactor pipeline is functional, but I’m still seeing manual steps slowing things down. Even with the AI doing most of the heavy lifting—deep scans, dependency analysis, auto-removals—it’s clear the feedback loops aren’t tight enough yet.
Ran the deep_refactor_scan.py again. It’s solid at flagging unused functions, imports, and dead files... but I’m hitting the usual serialization errors (set objects tripping JSON dumps). That’s a quick fix—just converting those before export—but it’s a symptom. There are still too many points where human intervention is assumed. Waste of cycles.
Also dug into the system audit. Trading agents? Scattered. Some logic duplicated across tbow_trade_executor.py, tbow_tactic_agent.py, and trading_robot.py. Need to merge and centralize. Real-time reinforcement learning isn’t running yet on live trades... which is leaving gains on the table. That’s moving up the priority list.
The cleanup scripts worked—migrated unused files, backed up what’s worth saving, and pruned the clutter. But again, manual triggers. I need to set event-driven automation here. No reason for me to keep calling scripts directly.
What’s next:
Auto-apply AI refactors when they pass static analysis + tests. Skip the manual review unless the system flags something risky.
Merge trading logic into one streamlined agent. Live learning, live execution.
Automate dependency checks and environment validation at runtime.
Structured logs feeding into a dashboard, not raw outputs I have to dig through.
Tighten the loop... cut the lag... make every action self-reinforcing.
