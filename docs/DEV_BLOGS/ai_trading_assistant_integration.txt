Devlog: Clean Code, Cleaner Intentions
What’s the trade-off between simplicity and control?
I’ve been thinking about that a lot while cleaning up the AI Blogging styles and restructuring the Tbow Tactics templates. There’s this constant pull to make things “perfect,” but every time I overengineer, I lose speed… and honestly, clarity. Today was about pulling back… simplifying without losing precision.
What I worked on...
Got the Tbow Tactics post structure dialed in. Custom fields are feeding clean into the dynamic templates now—no more hardcoding. Categories are streamlined… bullish, bearish, neutral. Kept it lean.
Also did a full sweep of the AI Blogging CSS. Turns out, a lot of what I thought was “universal” styling was messing with the core site layout… the nav menu took the biggest hit. So I scoped it down. Entry-content blocks stay in their lane now.
Cleaned up the workflow on the Tools Archive page… stripped back the unnecessary UI and pushed towards a more modular setup. Less noise.
What broke... or was tricky...
The container class was overriding stuff I didn’t expect—threw off the primary menu layout until I caught it.
Another one: I spent too much time styling section boxes that ended up getting cut anyway. Lesson… don’t style until the structure is locked.
What’s next...
Alpaca integration is on deck… Robin_stock is out.
Going to move from static plans to real-time decision models soon… but I’m pacing that rollout.
Also tightening the research tool UX—next content drops are going to walk people through it step by step.
