Devlog Update:
How do you keep things moving forward when you're juggling so many different parts of the same system?
Today’s focus was on merging a couple of versions of the AutoPostScheduler code. Took the time to consolidate everything into one clean file—methods, unit tests, the works. Everything needed to flow without overlap, and that meant making sure the functionality was intact while avoiding redundancy.
The auto-publish method got some extra attention. I added debug print statements to track what’s happening when posts go live. Kind of cool to see how the system moves in real time, but also a reminder that the smallest change can make a big impact on flow.
On the test side, I just folded everything into one batch. All the scheduling, rescheduling, deletion, auto-publishing—everything you’d expect. The biggest challenge was making sure the tests lined up and nothing got left behind. You know, preventing duplicate scheduling and managing the time-based conditions was more tricky than it sounds, but it’s all looking solid now.
What’s next? Time to run a couple of tests and make sure everything holds up. After that, it’ll be about refining the auto-publish logic and maybe adding a few more edge cases to really test the limits.
