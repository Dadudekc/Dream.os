“Where am I still reacting... instead of automating?”
Traded options yesterday... simple play... but this morning I had to double-check if the markets were open because of Jimmy Carter’s funeral. Manual search... again. That’s when it clicked—still too much reliance on me checking things that should be automated.
It’s subtle, but it adds up.
Latency in decision-making... energy leaks in small confirmations.
Spent time breaking it down...
The core bottleneck is dependency on external checks—market status, settlement confirmations, even news that impacts execution speed. Right now, I’m still pulling that data manually or on-demand. That’s not scalable. And it’s not aligned with where I’m driving this system.
Next step is clear:
Auto-monitoring of market closures (webhooks + trading platform triggers).
A bot that tracks T+1 settlements, pings me when funds are clear... no more guessing.
AI filtering the news for events that mess with my flow—direct feeds, actionable signals, no noise.
Also realized I’m still writing out templates for projects by hand...
That’s going to a dynamic generator... probably piped into the API layer.
What’s tricky about this?
Nothing big technically—just friction in my own process. It’s the human loop I’m cleaning up here. These are the last threads I need to cut to get closer to a fully autonomous execution stack.
Next up...
I’m building out the bot to watch settlements and closing the gap on market alerts. Then turning the project templates into API-first workflows.
One step tighter... one less thing in the way.
