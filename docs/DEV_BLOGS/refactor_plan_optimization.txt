Devlog // AI Debugger Stack Audit + System Convergence Push
How much energy am I wasting on systems that should already be talking to each other?
This one's been circling in my head the last couple hours... after walking through the AI debugger, agent registry, memory management, and all the patching tools, it's obvious—too much is running in parallel without convergence. Every subsystem is doing the job, but they're not feeding each other fast enough. I’m bleeding time between handoffs.
Here's what I’ve been working through today:
Cleaned up and optimized the AgentRegistry and AgentDispatcher—trying to strip down redundant agent roles. There's too much crossover between AIAgentWithMemory, CustomAgent, and some of the older legacy hooks. Feels like I’m duplicating mental models instead of merging them.
Pulled apart the DebugAgent routines. Right now, they’re still logging patch suggestions and fixes but aren’t automatically rolling those insights back into the trading stack or the content workflows. That’s a bottleneck. If an AI patch works, it should auto-trigger an update across the system, not wait for me to review it.
Also found the trading logic (MACD curl scripts, execution models) aren’t adapting dynamically. The AI agents should be auto-recalibrating parameters based on market feedback... right now, it's too manual. Not acceptable.
What broke or tripped me up...
Unicode errors in the logger outputs. Classic Windows encoding choke. Logging emojis on Windows (cmd) is still a pain, but I’m not removing them—just need to pipe logs to a UTF-8 stream or drop the special characters when needed. Minor, but annoying.
AIAgentWithMemory threw a property setter issue when wiring up the memory manager. I missed that in the base class. Cleaned it, but that was a stall.
What’s next...
Unified Execution Protocol. That’s the priority. No more separate agents managing isolated workflows. I want a single dispatcher driving tasks, learning, and triggering trade and content cycles in real time.
I need AI debugging agents to self-heal without supervision. If a patch works, it goes live. If it fails, rollback, learn, and retry. No human in the loop.
Finally, all trading activity, patches, and insights need to auto-generate content. I don’t want to manually translate wins or experiments into posts—AI can do that. Time to wire that in.
One decision… infinite output.
"Build systems that replace yourself… then let them evolve faster than you ever could."
