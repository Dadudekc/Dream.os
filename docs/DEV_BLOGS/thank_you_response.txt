Question I’m sitting with...
Am I building systems that move as fast as I do… or are they dragging me back?
Quick drop on where my head’s at after the last system audit...
I’ve been running a lot of pieces in parallel—trading, automation, content—and at a glance, it looks clean. But digging in? There’s friction everywhere.
In trading...
Too many manual checks... I’m still gut-checking decisions that should be predictive and automated by now. The data pipeline’s linear when it should be parallel. Feels like I’m throttling my own execution speed...
On automation...
I’m spread thin across too many tools. Power Automate, Logic Apps, Azure Functions... each good in their lane, but the integration gaps are killing flow. Redundant triggers, double handling data... classic inefficiency. I need a unified framework here. Clean. Fast. One system.
Content generation...
Same issue. Manual reviews, fragmented creation steps, version control headaches. AI should be driving drafts, optimizing SEO, and pushing content. Instead, I’m wasting time where I don’t need to. That’s on me.
What’s tricky...
The temptation to tweak and layer more tools instead of cutting them back. It’s always easier to add than subtract.
But if I want real convergence, subtraction is the move.
What’s next...
Strip automation workflows to one framework
Refactor trading pipelines for parallel processing
AI-driven decision making in trading and content
Automate content review/publishing… no more bottlenecks
Simplify. Tighten. Speed up.
