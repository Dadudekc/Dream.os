Devlog // What's Diluting My Execution?
Been thinking about this a lot today...
Where exactly am I leaking time and energy?
I went deep into the weeds with the site.
Built out the front page flow to showcase the ebook—"Roadmap"—with a heavy focus on list building. We’ve got the pitch dialed... "We’re going to charge for it soon." Simple, direct.
But the real work was automating delivery so people aren’t stuck waiting or emailing me asking where their PDF is.
Pulled the ebook form out of shortcode hell and wired it into a proper custom form handler.
We’re collecting emails, firing off the ebook via email with a clean download link.
For now, it's all running through WordPress...
But I’m seeing where the next bottleneck hits.
Transactional emails on WordPress? Sketchy.
Need to push that off to Mailchimp or ConvertKit, maybe SendGrid for delivery.
No point building an email delivery system when one already exists.
Next sprint.
The media side...
Spent too much time cycling on images.
DALL-E broke half the time.
Had to redo simple things like removing a letter or changing a color.
That’s on me. I should’ve had a brand style guide ready to go before we started asset generation.
We were chasing aesthetics instead of executing the system.
Batch the requests. Define the standard. Move on.
No more getting stuck there.
What’s next...
Get the email funnel running through an external system.
Map the ebook > Discord > Paid offer flow and tighten that up.
Start pulling insights from trade logs into content themes.
Everything I do on the trading side needs to be feeding content...
No separation between the work and the story anymore.
“The system that executes faster wins.”
Let’s get it.
