"Where am I slowing myself down?"
That’s the question on my mind after breaking things down today... Been looking at the whole workflow, front to back—trading, automation, content, the site, everything. I’m realizing I’ve built a lot of good pieces... but they aren’t moving together yet. And that’s where the energy is leaking.
Here’s the breakdown...
Trading...
I’ve still got too much emotion in the decision-making loop. The TBOW tactics are solid, but they’re stuck in manual mode. Same with trade sizing. It’s all there... just needs to be automated so I can stop playing “Riskit for the Biscuit” and let the system run itself. Robinhood API’s still a mess. Spent more time than I should on authentication issues that just keep popping back up. Feels like I’m patching holes in something I should’ve replaced by now.
Automation...
There’s too much going on in different places... Discord bots, AI models, Robinhood scripts... and none of it’s talking to each other yet. That’s the bottleneck. I need an AI-driven orchestration layer—Node-RED or Airflow maybe. Something to centralize the whole system... where data comes in, AI makes decisions, and bots act. Right now, I’m the middleman... and I’m slowing it all down.
Content...
The devlogs, tactics, and breakdowns are good—but still hand-done. I’m writing posts, formatting for different platforms, manually scheduling... It’s burning time I could be putting into the system itself. Next move is AI-templated posts that auto-publish. Content needs to run on its own pipeline so I can focus on building.
What’s next...
Automate TBOW tactic generation and deployment.
Migrate away from Robinhood API—either Alpaca or Interactive Brokers.
Build the orchestration layer to connect the pieces.
Set up CI/CD pipelines to remove myself from the deploy process.
Get content publishing off my plate and into a system.
Gotta move smarter, not harder...
