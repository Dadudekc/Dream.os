Devlog: Where’s the drag in your system?
Been sitting with this question all day...
Where am I burning time, energy, or focus for no real return?
I ran a systems audit on myself... and it was humbling.
The biggest drag right now is in how I’m splitting energy between trading, content, and building FreeRideInvestor into something bigger. I’m switching contexts too much... manually doing things that should be flowing on their own.
So I started tightening things up.
Today was about drawing hard lines between what’s repeatable and what’s not.
Locked in 1-2 trading setups I can run mechanically... less decision fatigue, more consistency.
Working on an automated journal that spits out insights after every session. That’ll feed directly into content instead of me sitting there trying to pull a lesson out of thin air.
Built out a few content templates so I’m not overthinking posts, devlogs, or course drops... saves mental bandwidth.
What broke?
Not much yet... but the resistance is in letting go of the "manual process" comfort zone.
It’s easy to say “I’ll just do it quick”...
But that’s the trap.
Quick adds up. Quick drains energy I need for bigger moves.
What’s next...
Batch content. Automate post-trade workflows.
Tighten the feedback loop between trading performance and what I teach in the community.
Everything I do in the market should fuel what I build here.
"Slow is smooth... smooth is fast."
Let’s keep building.
