What’s the simplest version of this that actually works?
Spent today breaking the FreeRideInvestor Trade Analyzer down to bare bones. No frills... just a clean front-end upload flow, file processing, and data display. Users hit the page, upload their brokerage statements (PDF or CSV), and see their trades right there. That's it.
Dropped the admin page... we’re not doing backend uploads. No one wants to deal with that friction. Straight from the front end. Focus is on clarity and speed.
Built a shortcode [trade_analyzer] so I can drop this anywhere in WordPress. Right now, it’s handling uploads, running Python scripts for parsing, pushing trades into the wp_trades table, and spitting out the stats: total trades, P/L, win rate... plus a simple table showing their last ten trades.
Biggest headache? The database schema. Ran into some missing columns—classic case of an old schema hanging around... missing profit_loss and trade_date. I built a check into the activation hook to force those columns if they don’t exist. Simple fix... but one of those things you only catch when something breaks in real time.
Kept it single-user for now. No multi-user data isolation yet... not the priority. This MVP just needs to work. Multi-user comes later.
Next up... thinking about adding some basic visualizations. Maybe a quick Chart.js line chart for P/L over time. After that... AI analytics are on the horizon.
