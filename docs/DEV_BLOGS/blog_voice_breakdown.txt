Devlog: Is this friction necessary… or am I holding onto it?
Been thinking about that a lot today.
Where am I still choosing to carry weight that could be stripped out… automated… offloaded?
Anyway. Here’s the update…
Worked on structuring three TSLA blog posts. They’re clean… useful… each one hits a different level of trader maturity.
One breaks down what “big size” even means on TSLA’s book…
One’s about using the order book as a read tool, instead of chasing indicators…
The last is a cheat sheet—straight to the point, setups included.
Wrote them, then had to dive back in and wrap the HTML, linking them together, making sure they connect in a way that makes sense for someone binge-reading them. That’s the thing… if I’m dropping three posts in a day, they can’t be scattered. They need to flow. They need to work.
But… here’s where I hit the wall.
I’m still in the weeds on stuff that should’ve been automated already.
Manual formatting… link checking… creating call-to-actions by hand.
It’s not hard work.
It’s distracting work.
And the bigger issue… these posts are anchored to TSLA at very specific price levels.
I’m realizing that locks me into a cycle—either rewrite or accept content decay.
Neither of those is scalable.
What’s next?
Automate the content pipeline… I’ve said that before, but this is now a must.
Build a live data layer for my posts so I’m not stuck updating numbers. The system should evolve as the price does.
And I need a centralized place where my insights go first—one source of truth—then I can spin off blogs, tweets, vids… whatever.
No more duplicate work.
That’s it for now.
