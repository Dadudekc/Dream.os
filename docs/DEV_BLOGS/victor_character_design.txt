What happens when you decide you’re done relying on tools and start relying on yourself?
That’s been on my mind today. I’ve been thinking about where I want to take this… not just the project, but the process. Spent a chunk of time breaking down my first coding goal—building a handwritten to-do list app. Not fancy. Not AI-assisted. Just me, the keyboard, and Python.
Started from square one... again. Had to step back and really make sure I understood what each line of code is doing—not just memorizing it, but reading it like plain English. Functions, loops, lists... all the basics, but I made sure I wasn’t skipping steps. I slowed it down. Repetition without understanding is wasted time. I’m done wasting time.
One thing that hit me hard was how much energy gets diluted when I’m juggling too many things at once. Context switching kills momentum. So... I’m setting tighter boundaries. Time-blocking deep work. Coding without distractions. This isn’t about building the app—it’s about building my system.
What broke today?
Mostly my own patterns. Realized I’ve been reactive, not strategic. Relying on what’s in front of me instead of building a process that feeds itself. That stops here. I’m setting up a knowledge base. Every session will have a log. What I learned. What I broke. What’s next.
Next up...
Lay out the skeleton of the app on paper. Functions first. No keyboard until I’m clear on structure. After that, it’s handwritten code. Clean. Simple. Mine.
