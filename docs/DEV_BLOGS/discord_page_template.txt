Devlog 3.16 — Systems and Fragments
Ever ask yourself if you’re really moving the needle... or just cycling through the same loops with better wallpaper?
That’s where my head’s been most of today.
Here’s where we’re at...
Spent most of the time merging and cleaning up Digital Dreamscape—specifically Chapter 1-1. Pulled together all the fractured pieces into one clean flow. Felt good to finally get a consistent tone across the whole thing. The crooked tower and Shifting Fields are hitting right now... they’re tight, they’re doing what they need to do.
Also mapped out the 1-2 framework. It’s simple, clean... intro, trial, fallout. Left room for deeper world-building without getting bloated. Kept it modular so we can scale the narrative faster later.
On the system side...
We built out the project.json file to track chapters, lore, assets. Needed that structure bad. It’ll make pulling pieces together less of a mess. Thinking we’ll hook it into some automation later for deployment and versioning... baby steps.
Also drafted a Discord update for the community. Debated dropping it because the market’s closed and I wasn’t sure it mattered... but consistency wins. We’re pushing through.
Wasn’t all smooth.
Lot of time got eaten by the manual stuff—file handling, JSON, Discord setup. I’m seeing where it slows me down. That’s the next hit list: kill the manual loops, get better pipeline flow. Automation’s gotta step up if we’re serious about scale.
What’s next...
Get the Discord microservice running for the invite links. No more cron hacks.
Build out the knowledge graph for Dreamscape lore so I’m not holding it all in my head.
Start automating TBOWTactic drops... it’s time.
GitOps for the whole system. No more patchwork.
