"How do you bounce back without losing the fire that burned you in the first place?"
Quick drop while it’s still fresh...
Spent some time looking over the portfolio numbers today. We kicked off the year strong—too strong. Zeal turned into overconfidence. Rode that high until it wasn’t sustainable, and the whole thing cratered harder than expected. Classic. Burned bright... and nearly burned out.
What’s left? Embers. But they’re still hot. And last week, we sparked something again. Small moves, but intentional. Clean, patient. This week, the focus is fanning those flames—rebuilding with control instead of impulse. No need for fireworks. Just heat. Steady growth. Learned the hard way not to force the momentum. It builds on its own when you respect the process.
Next up: reviewing the positions that are still underperforming and making a call—double down or cut loose. No dead weight. Every dollar’s gotta be pulling its weight from here on.
One spark at a time...
