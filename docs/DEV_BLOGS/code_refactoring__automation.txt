What happens when the system gets bloated? When you’re building fast, iterating hard, and suddenly you’re drowning in redundant processes... How much friction are you carrying without even noticing?
Spent most of the day breaking down the architecture—no hype, just dissecting what’s actually slowing this thing down.
The AI Debugger was supposed to be autonomous. It’s close, but not clean. DebugAgent, DebuggingPipeline, and DebuggingStrategy were stepping on each other. Too many overlapping retries. Too much scattered logic. So, I’m merging it all into one streamlined orchestrator. Less moving parts... more execution.
Same thing with patch validation and retries—every model had its own retry loops. DeepSeek... OpenAI... Mistral... all doing their own thing. Wasteful. That’s getting centralized under AIRefactorPipeline. One loop. Adaptive scoring instead of dumb retries.
On the trading side... realized my MACD curl strategy is solid but the feedback loop is manual. Missed opportunities because it’s not self-correcting in real-time. I’m connecting the AI Debugger into the trading execution flow. If something breaks or underperforms, the system needs to diagnose and fix itself. No more waiting for me to review logs.
Content’s lagging behind too. Repurposing posts is still semi-manual. Fixing that. Building out an autonomous content repurposing pipeline—same post, multi-platform, zero friction. Adding AI-driven trend detection so content isn’t just reactive... it’s predictive.
What’s next...
Merging Debugger systems
Finalizing AIRefactorPipeline retry logic
Hooking trading execution errors into automated self-analysis
Parallel content distribution
Caching AI responses to speed everything up
Systems only feel fast until you zoom out and see where the drag is. Clean code isn’t enough—clean workflows are where the power is.
