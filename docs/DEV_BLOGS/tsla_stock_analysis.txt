Devlog Drop
Question I’m sitting with:
Where am I bleeding time in places that should already be automated?
Today’s breakdown...
Did a full system audit—trading, automation, content loops.
I’ve known for a minute that the workflows are solid, but not tight.
Too much manual input.
Too much waiting around for signals I should already be getting piped in.
And when I’m done trading, the insights don’t flow anywhere unless I manually move them.
It’s bottlenecked.
Which means execution velocity is capped... and that’s not where I want to be.
What stood out...
Manual chart watching is a time suck. Even if it’s fast, it’s not fast enough.
No fusion engine yet—EMAs, RSI, MACD... they’re all running solo instead of converging into something actionable without me having to think about it.
The content side is lagging too. Insights are getting lost because I’m not capturing them in real time. If it’s not noted right away, it’s gone.
There’s no self-optimizing feedback loop on the trades. Winning or losing, I have to do post-analysis manually... and that’s slow.
What’s next...
Phase 1:
Build the signal fusion engine—make the data work for me, not the other way around.
Automate journaling and performance review loops... close that feedback cycle.
Start capturing insights as I work—voice-to-text, straight into AI-assisted content drafts.
No more bottlenecks. No more leaks.
Phase 2 and 3... they’re sketched out, but I’m staying focused on the first fires.
One system at a time.
But it’s all moving toward a fully autonomous, self-optimizing machine.
