How often do I overcomplicate what just needs to be simple?
Spent today tightening up the trade analysis template... nothing fancy, just making sure the structure is clean and it flows. Started with the raw HTML I had, but realized pretty quick I was overwriting parts of the original template that were already dialed in. Classic.
Scrapped the extra styling and locked into the template as-is. Followed the section structure—Technical Analysis, Market Context, Grading Setups, Conclusion, Reflections. No extra wrappers. Just clean and readable.
Tweaked the footer next... it was stacking links vertically, and it needed to run horizontal. Flexbox solved it—added display: flex, spaced it with gap: 20px, and it cleaned up right away. Simple, but necessary. No need to force anything beyond that.
What’s next...
Run through a few more reports in the template and see if there’s any friction in live usage. If it’s smooth, it’s locked. If not... back to the bench.
