Devlog — 2025-01-13
Question I’m sitting with... Why does friction always show up at the edges of scale?
Spent the day in Azure land again... trying to tighten up the infrastructure for TradingRobotPlug2. Felt like I was wrestling a ghost most of the time.
Every time I thought I was logged in, Azure kicked me back out. MFA loops... broken subscriptions... service principal setups that should’ve been simple but kept hitting walls.
Kept seeing the same error—SubscriptionNotFound—even though the subscription was right there in the portal and showing as enabled. Over and over...
Burned way too much time trying to get az storage account create to work, only to realize the session kept losing context.
Got tired of the loop...
Stepped back and broke it down...
What’s really missing is a clean baseline setup.
No more manual clicks. No more “am I logged in” guesswork. I need persistent service principals locked in, Bicep scripts to deploy infra in seconds, and a CI/CD pipe that enforces the state. This ad-hoc stuff? It’s done.
On top of that, the serverless fetch function testing needs to shift out of notebooks. It’s messy. I need a tighter test harness, probably running inside GitHub Actions, and dockerized local mocks so I can iterate without chasing my tail.
What’s next?
Build and test the service principal for TradingRobotPlug2
Get Bicep templates written for core infra—storage, RGs, MySQL Flexible Server
Drop the first GitHub Actions pipeline for deploy + tests
Clean up my local dev container to match Azure Functions runtime
Centralize logs so I’m not hunting across five tools
The goal is convergence... simple, repeatable, and fast.
