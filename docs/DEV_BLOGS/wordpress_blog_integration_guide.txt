Devlog: Where’s the Bottleneck?
Ever catch yourself wondering... how much time am I bleeding chasing problems I shouldn’t be dealing with?
That’s where I was today. Felt like I was spending more energy just getting the system to run than building anything new. Bouncing between Python installs, broken environments... wasted cycles. I kept activating freeride_env but still ended up running scripts through the wrong interpreter. One was Anaconda, another was Python 3.13... packages installed in one, missing in the other. It was messy.
So I stripped it down... cut the noise.
Tore out the redundancies and committed to one unified environment. freeride_env is now the single source of truth. No more guessing which Python is in charge... no more fixing the same errors twice.
There’s still work ahead.
The pipeline isn’t fully automated yet—generating blogs is still a manual trigger. No recursive feedback loop yet either... data isn’t informing the prompts or improving itself. That’s the next push: automate the triggers, close the loop, and get this thing learning on its own.
But today was about clarity.
Simplify the system... cut the excess... get back to building.
