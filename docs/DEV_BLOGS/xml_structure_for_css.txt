What’s the actual cost of context switching... and how much of my energy is being bled in the seams between systems?
Spent today dissecting the FreerideInvestor system. Most of it. Went deep.
Turns out, I’m burning way more time than I should on stuff that should already be automated...
Manual structuring, hand-assembling XML for configs, writing out data formats from scratch—every single time. That’s adding friction I don’t need.
The Python fetch scripts are too linear... I’m calling APIs one after another when I could be hitting them concurrently. No caching yet either, so I’m making redundant calls that waste cycles...
Energy leak.
On the content side, there’s a gap. I’ve got trade plans, sentiment analysis, historicals... but they’re not flowing into automated content yet. No pipeline pushing reports, newsletters, or even simple Discord drops... Everything’s still a manual relay between insights and output. Another bottleneck.
Here’s where it gets interesting though—
If I refactor the fetch system to async, add Redis caching, and wire automated content generation directly into the trade insights... things move faster. A lot faster.
Next step is setting up code generation templates so I’m not rebuilding the same XML/JSON blocks manually. Just feed data and let it render.
Once that’s in place, I’ll layer CI/CD over the whole thing with schema validation and tests... Cut out the human error factor.
The real work isn’t about more features. It’s about reducing the noise between systems so they can self-organize...
And that’s where I’m focused.
What’s next...
Async I/O rewrite
Redis cache drop-in
Template generation (Jinja2 maybe?)
And the pipeline from trading insights to content posts... that gets wired tight.
