Devlog // 2025-03-16
What actually matters most right now?
Looking back at January, I’ve been feeling like I wasn’t productive enough... but after laying it all out, it’s clearer now. A lot of the work was groundwork—stuff that doesn’t show up in clean deliverables but sets the stage for execution.
That said... February needs to hit different.
I’m stripping it back to what’s highest priority for me right now:
Finish FreeRide Investor
All plugins for the dashboard.
Clean up the entire codebase.
Possibly roll out an auto-blog feature—still on the table.
Get my GitHub in order
Every repo needs to work cleanly on clone.
Docs need to be tight.
It needs to look like I take my projects seriously—because I do.
Build a system to track everything I’m working on
Something simple to start, but it needs to give me a clear view of all my projects in flight.
I’m probably going to fold that into Focus Forge, with a Momentum Tracker baked in...
Daily streaks, progress logs, maybe sync it with Pomodoro runs.
Right now, it’s all about building, organizing, and optimizing. No extras.
What was tricky today was pulling back and asking the hard question—am I working on what actually matters?
Feels like I’m there now.
What’s next...
Lock in FreeRide Investor by the end of Week 2.
GitHub cleanup after that.
Momentum Tracker for Focus Forge in Week 4.
