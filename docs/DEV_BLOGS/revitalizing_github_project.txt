“Where am I slowing things down by overcomplicating what should already be systemized?”
That’s the question I kept circling back to today...
And I got the answer pretty fast once I looked at how messy the trading strategy process was starting to get.
Spent the bulk of the session rebuilding the TSLA MACD + RSI strategy. It was already decent, but I wanted it to run clean, be tight on entries, and give me something I could hand off without needing to explain how to use it every time. Filtered out the noise—tightened RSI thresholds, added a volatility filter with Bollinger Bands, and dialed in ATR-based trailing stops. Took a while to get the triggers syncing right... but once it clicked, it clicked. Win rate’s up over 60%. Profit factor is holding above 2.7. That’s enough for me to call it solid for now.
The real friction wasn’t the coding... it was the workflow.
Too much time wasted switching contexts—writing Pine Script, writing dev notes, writing showcase pages... all manually.
So I ran a quick audit on the process.
The biggest gap? No system unifying strategy creation → documentation → deployment.
That’s gotta change.
The plan is simple now:
Modular Pine Script components so I’m not rewriting entry/exit logic every time.
A JSON schema for each strategy—one file powers dev blogs, showcase pages, and WP listings.
Git + CI/CD so strategy updates trigger automatic content refreshes.
Hypothesis-driven testing for strategy validation... remove the guesswork.
This is what I mean by system convergence.
Everything self-organizing toward one goal—speed and clarity.
Next, I’ll wire up the strategy-to-content automation and get version control locked in.
Once that’s live, pushing a new strategy will be as simple as committing a file and letting the system do its thing.
No more bottlenecks.
Just execution.
