Devlog // Did I overthink the entry conditions... or did I underthink the exits?
Cleaned up a lot today.
Started by refining that trade analyzer plugin. Got the PHP sorted so it pulls results from the Python script and displays them on-page. Hooked up a shortcode so we can drop it into any WordPress template now. Then we built out the template itself... simple, clean, does the job. It’s ready for front-facing use. The stats rendering works, but I might tweak the formatting later if it bugs me.
Then shifted gears back into the Pine Script strategy. That thing was dead... no trades triggering. Not even a whisper. Looked at what his code was doing and realized: the entry conditions were tight—maybe too tight. On top of that, the position sizing logic wasn’t realistic for execution. Fixed the entry triggers by adding a buffer on the swing levels, hard-coded a clean contract size to test, and reworked scaling so it actually builds instead of overwriting.
Stop-loss and take-profit exits are now explicit. No guesswork. Alerts fire clean. It’s triggering trades. Finally.
What’s next...
I’ll run the Pine Script through some historicals to see how it handles different volatility setups. Might layer in trailing stops if I feel spicy. On the plugin side, we’ll probably start piping in Alpaca data soon.
