"Where is the system bleeding time... and why am I still manually connecting the dots?"
Did a deep dive today... looked at where my workflows are dragging, and the verdict is clear.
I’m burning too much time stitching pieces together by hand... tactical playbooks, frontend components, and content drops.
It’s all solid work... but it’s costing me execution velocity.
The whole loop—from market signal to actionable strategy—is still getting bottlenecked in manual prep.
What I worked on:
Mapped out the redundancies across trading, automation, and content builds.
Broke down the CSS and frontend structures... realized I’ve been duplicating components instead of systemizing them.
Took apart the trading process... every playbook and strategy update is still a manual lift. The intel is sharp... but converting it into something the system can push out in real-time? Not there yet.
What broke / What was tricky:
The biggest drag is me being in the loop for every decision-to-content cycle.
There’s no autonomous pipeline spitting out trade plans or tactics dynamically from live data.
CSS component structure is bloated... repeating code because there’s no central component library.
Content generation is stuck in manual mode... HTML/CSS builds instead of parametric templates.
What’s next:
Build an autonomous trading playbook generator... live data in, JSON-based strategy out.
Refactor the frontend—centralize components, probably move to a modular system (React or Svelte... still deciding).
Spin up parameterized templates for all tactical content so I’m not hand-coding every post.
Set up a full CI/CD pipeline for frontend and content pushes—zero manual deployment.
This needs to move fast. I’m capping too much execution speed manually bridging these pieces...
"Speed is not the goal... alignment is."
Let’s tighten it up.
