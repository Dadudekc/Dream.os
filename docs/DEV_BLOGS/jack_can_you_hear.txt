Devlog: Are you building momentum… or just moving in circles?
Been thinking about that a lot today while hammering through this Discord buildout.
Started at the bottom and worked my way up… off-topic to trading-help to trader-wins to educational-resources and all the rest. Channel by channel. Line by line. Felt like laying bricks… repetitive, but necessary if you want the foundation solid.
What I realized halfway through—I'm burning energy on micro-decisions that should’ve been systemized already. Every time I rewrote a channel topic or a starter post, I caught myself thinking… "I’ve done this already." That’s a red flag. So I stepped back, stripped it down, and templated the tone. Kept it modular. Made it faster.
The tricky part? Fighting the urge to over-polish. Wanted to get it perfect before moving on, but that’s old thinking. Better to get it live and test it in the wild… tweak it off data, not assumptions.
What’s next…
I’m setting up engagement tracking to see how people actually move through the server. No guessing.
And I’m wiring the trading systems directly into Discord… automate what I can, so my focus stays on the work that actually matters.
...
Momentum is everything… but only if it’s pointed in the right direction.
