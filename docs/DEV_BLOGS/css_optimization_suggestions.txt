"What’s the real bottleneck here—my system... or me?"
That’s been running through my head while tearing down what I’ve built so far.
I ran a full audit of the trading bot and its architecture today. The raw takeaway? It works... but it’s not fast enough. Not responsive enough. Not self-sufficient enough.
I’m still the bottleneck.
The Robinhood API flow needs manual login. Every time. That friction breaks momentum, and it's not sustainable if I want to scale or automate beyond myself. Authentication has to be automated, clean, no touch. Azure Key Vault’s getting pulled into the stack next.
The system’s polling data on a schedule... but it needs to be event-driven. Async, fast, reactive. Right now, it’s reactive on a timer, not on triggers. That means I’m late to trades I should be first on. Switching this to an event-driven core is priority.
Database’s on SQLite... and I’m feeling it. It was fine to get rolling, but it can’t scale. It’s going to choke if I push it harder. Moving to Azure SQL or Postgres. Whichever plays nicer with async pipelines and lets me scale the backtests and live logs without breaking.
And I’m still using a GUI to trigger things manually in PyQt... yeah, no. It was a good build for learning. Not for scaling. I’m ripping the GUI out and setting up API endpoints and dashboards instead. I want automation running... and monitoring that lets me see what I need, when I need it. No distractions.
On the content side... I’m spending time writing logs manually when AI could be summarizing system actions for me. That’s wasted bandwidth. I’m building a pipeline to auto-generate devlogs from system events and logs. Same voice. Same insights. Less grind.
What broke?
My tolerance for redundant tasks.
What’s tricky?
Balancing precision and scale without breaking trust in the system.
What’s next?
Automate token refresh + Key Vault
Move the bot core to event-driven async
Migrate database and decouple reads/writes
Drop the GUI, launch a clean dashboard
Auto-gen logs from system actions... so I can stay focused on the build
