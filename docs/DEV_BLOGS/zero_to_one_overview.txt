What’s the difference between competing… and actually building something no one else can?
Been thinking about Zero to One a lot today. Thiel’s concept of going from zero to one—creating something new, not just adding to what’s already there—hits different when you’re deep in systems work. Makes me look at TradingRobotPlug and FreeRide Investor through a sharper lens. Am I building something that just iterates… or something that flips the game?
Not much building today... more reflection. Sometimes that’s the real work.
What’s next: I want to sit with the monopoly concept a little longer... get clearer on how I can niche down before scaling out. Precision over speed right now.
