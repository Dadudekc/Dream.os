What bottlenecks are hiding in the obvious... and how much energy is slipping through because I’m not slowing down enough to see them?
Quick drop...
Spent time today looking at the design flow for the stock research tool. It’s functional, but I’m noticing the same issue I keep running into—front-loading clarity is everything. Too often, I start building without locking in the criteria. It slows everything down... not because the build is bad, but because I’m constantly having to backtrack and redefine.
Same thing happened here. I dropped the image without a clear directive. Took extra back-and-forth to align on what mattered—the UI redesign. Obvious in hindsight. This is a pattern across the board... trading flows, automation sequences, content pipelines. Lack of upfront clarity forces me into micro-decisions mid-execution. That breaks flow... and flow is where I do my best work.
So I did an internal audit while I was at it. Saw three major inefficiencies:
Delayed intent clarity
Redundant validation loops
No structured decision framework for UI/UX or trade logic
Solutions are pretty clear...
I’m building a prompt briefing template so AI interactions are clean and scoped from the jump.
Modular design system is getting priority—no more subjective design loops.
And decision matrices for both trading and UX adjustments... automated and real-time.
All of this feeds into AI workflow orchestration, which I’ve been meaning to tighten up anyway.
What’s next...
Lock in the design system.
Get the decision trees running.
Make the system move without me having to constantly steer it.
