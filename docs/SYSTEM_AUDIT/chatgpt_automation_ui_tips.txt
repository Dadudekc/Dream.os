System Audit: Strategic Bottleneck Analysis & Optimization Plan
Objective
Accelerate convergence across Victor‚Äôs core workflows‚Äîtrading, automation, and content generation‚Äîby surgically identifying inefficiencies and deploying immediate, high-impact solutions.
üîç Bottleneck & Inefficiency Breakdown
1Ô∏è‚É£ Manual Context Switching Between Domains
Observation: Frequent pivots between building automation systems, refining AI model architecture, and high-focus trading sessions. This fractures cognitive flow and diffuses energy.
Impact: Context switching delays execution loops, fragments momentum, and leads to task queues piling up rather than self-resolving.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Redundant Model Management Prior to Plugin Loader
Observation: Earlier iterations of the Automation Engine required manual integration of new models, creating unnecessary friction in system scaling.
Impact: Time-consuming imports and edits. Slows deployment of new strategies and limits system modularity.
‚úÖ Now solved with dynamic plugin loading‚Äîkeep reinforcing this structure.
3Ô∏è‚É£ Lack of Autonomous AI Feedback Loops
Observation: No AI-driven self-evaluation exists yet to score or validate LLM-generated outputs before deployment.
Impact: Human intervention is still required for quality assurance. This slows down the deploy-test-learn loop and introduces latency in scaling AI-driven code refinement.
4Ô∏è‚É£ Manual Prompt Engineering & Metadata Gaps
Observation: Prompts are still constructed manually or semi-manually without consistently leveraging system intelligence (e.g., ProjectScanner insights).
Impact: Limits the system‚Äôs ability to dynamically adapt prompts based on project complexity, file structures, or strategic objectives. Wasted cycles on prompt revisions that should be automated.
5Ô∏è‚É£ Unoptimized Logging & Monitoring Prior to Refactor
Observation: Logging and error handling were initially inconsistent and reactive.
Impact: Increases time-to-debug, makes post-mortems harder, and dilutes operator insight into system behavior.
‚úÖ Refactor initiated‚Äîensure logs feed into central monitoring dashboards or AI analytics.
6Ô∏è‚É£ Human Bottleneck in Model Selection
Observation: Model selection, though automated in line count terms, still requires manual overrides for nuanced control.
Impact: Operator remains in the loop for decisions that should be automated through intelligent meta-selectors (e.g., complexity scoring + historical success rates).
‚öôÔ∏è Immediate High-Impact Optimizations
‚úÖ 1. Implement the AI Self-Evaluation Loop
Action: Build AISelfEvaluator to audit LLM outputs before they return to the system pipeline.
Impact: Autonomous QA closes the loop. Reduces manual review to exceptions, not standard process.
Velocity Gain: +30% execution acceleration in AI code refinement cycles.
‚úÖ 2. Integrate ProjectScanner Insights into Prompt Generation
Action: Feed project complexity and structural metadata directly into dynamic prompt builders.
Impact: More relevant and optimized AI outputs on first pass. Fewer cycles spent re-prompting.
Velocity Gain: +20% reduction in prompt engineering overhead.
‚úÖ 3. Auto-Tune Model Selection Using Meta-Data & AI Evaluation
Action: Replace manual override checkboxes with AI-driven meta-selectors that consider complexity, past model performance, and output evaluation scores.
Impact: Adaptive model selection removes the operator from routine decisions.
Velocity Gain: +25% throughput increase in batch processing.
‚úÖ 4. Centralize Logging and Telemetry for Feedback Loops
Action: Funnel logs into a single AI-augmented monitoring layer. Set thresholds for auto-repair triggers and anomaly detection.
Impact: Real-time awareness and automatic resolution of known failure modes.
Velocity Gain: +15% reduction in downtime and error handling latency.
‚úÖ 5. Consolidate Context Switching Through Unified Ops Windows
Action: Establish time-blocked, single-domain execution blocks (e.g., trading ops, AI pipeline buildout, content deployment), fed by an AI-prioritized task queue.
Impact: Maintains deep work states, reduces energy fragmentation.
Velocity Gain: +40% cognitive efficiency boost.
