System Audit: Workflow Bottlenecks and Optimization Strategy
Focus: Trading | Automation | Content Generation
Objective: Accelerate convergence and self-organization through surgical removal of bottlenecks and systemic inefficiencies.
1. Bottleneck Identification
A. Code Reorganization and Modularity (Automation / Trading)
Current State
Ongoing refactor into modular Swift Packages (Core, Shared, TBOWTactics).
Issues with module discovery (no such module 'Models' / 'Services').
Repeated cycles of swift build, swift test, and ad hoc troubleshooting.
Bottlenecks
Lack of clear interface contracts between modules, resulting in redundant debugging of dependencies.
Manual intervention in dependency management (repeated git add / git rm for file tracking).
Inefficient feedback loops during swift build due to fragmented dependency updates.
Root Cause
Incomplete decoupling of concerns and insufficiently abstracted services.
Module design driven by file structure rather than interface boundaries or domain-driven design principles.
B. Testing and Validation (Automation / Trading)
Current State
Reactive testing: Tests often follow rather than precede refactors.
UI and Integration Tests exist but are not leveraged as gatekeepers.
Bottlenecks
Manual testing post-refactor instead of automated pipelines enforcing test coverage before proceeding.
Delayed detection of integration faults (i.e., missing modules) prolongs troubleshooting.
Root Cause
Testing is an afterthought rather than an integrated flow within CI/CD.
Lack of pre-commit hooks or automated checks to enforce build and test integrity.
C. Version Control and Commit Practices (Automation / Content Gen)
Current State
Ad-hoc batch commits following local testing and file management.
Commits are descriptive but often occur after significant changes, introducing risk.
Bottlenecks
Delayed commit cycles increase risk of conflicting changes or lost context.
Repeated manual git add and file curation slow down momentum.
Root Cause
Lack of automated staging strategies, e.g., git hooks or intelligent file watching.
No branch policies that enforce incremental commits or pull request reviews.
D. AI Service Usage and Trading Automation (Trading / AI Integration)
Current State
Manual CLI-driven interaction with OpenAIService and NetworkManager.
AI-assisted features like trade plan generation are invoked on-demand rather than being pipeline-integrated.
Bottlenecks
Human-in-the-loop dependencies for running critical insight generation tools.
No automated triggers to generate insights or trade plans as new data arrives.
Root Cause
CLI serves as a prototype tool rather than an autonomous AI-driven agent.
Lack of event-driven architecture and real-time data pipeline integration.
2. Redundancy and Energy Dilution
Area Redundancy / Waste Recommendation
Module Imports Repeated failures due to manual import assumptions Centralize shared protocols in Core or Shared. Flatten dependency trees.
Build-Test Cycles Rebuilding repeatedly after small changes Implement watch mode or hot reload workflows.
Commit Management Manual adds/removes, delayed commits Adopt pre-commit hooks and automated diff staging tools (e.g., lint-staged).
AI Interaction Manual CLI queries for AI-generated insights Automate with cron jobs, triggers, or event listeners that invoke AI services as data flows.
Context Switching Shifting between swift build, git, and manual testing Leverage automation scripts for batch processing or full-cycle CI runs locally before pushing.
3. Immediate, High-Impact Optimizations
A. Modular Architecture Convergence
Simplify Module Dependencies
➔ Flatten Core and Shared relationships.
➔ Abstract shared protocols/interfaces to Core to avoid circular imports.
➔ Confirm all domain models reside in Core (no Models module if redundant).
B. CI/CD Enforcement
Pre-Commit Enforcement
➔ Add pre-commit hooks to run swift build && swift test.
➔ Automate staged file validation (e.g., lint, format, test).
Incremental Builds and Watchers
➔ Use swift build --watch (if available) or third-party file watchers to minimize manual triggers.
C. Automation of AI-Driven Insights
Event-Driven Data Processing
➔ Integrate NetworkManager with a scheduler (e.g., SwiftCron, Launchd) for periodic data pulls.
➔ Automatically pass new data through OpenAIService and generate trade plans without human intervention.
Autonomous CLI Enhancement
➔ Convert CLI into a daemon service with configurable triggers instead of interactive sessions.
D. Content Generation Systematization
Commit Message Templates
➔ Standardize commit messages with action-status summaries (e.g., [Module] - Added | Refactored | Removed).
Devlog Auto-Generation
➔ Automate weekly devlogs by scraping commit history and test outcomes.
➔ Use OpenAI to assist in summarizing and formatting progress reports.
4. Priority Action List: Maximum Velocity Execution
Priority Task Outcome
1 Flatten dependencies (Core owns domain models/protocols) Builds succeed, imports stabilize.
2 Pre-commit hook: swift build && swift test Prevent broken code from committing.
3 Automate data ingestion → AI analysis → Trade plan export Removes manual CLI bottleneck.
4 Refine CLI into daemon with schedule/event-based triggers Autonomous trading insights.
5 Commit strategy: small, atomic, enforced via hook policies Reduced merge conflicts, clear logs.
6 Automate devlog generation and AI-assisted summaries Consistent, scalable content output.
Summary
Victor, your workflows are highly iterative but human-dependent at key points that should be automated. By converging your architecture around autonomous AI pipelines and strict pre-flight checks, you'll unlock greater execution velocity, reduce friction, and accelerate convergence toward your system’s self-organizing AI-driven core.
Reflective Follow-Ups
How fast can you flatten your Core → Shared dependency graph to unlock clean module builds?
Would a unified task runner (e.g., Makefile or Rake) streamline your manual testing, building, and committing processes?
Are you ready to shift AI-driven analysis from reactive CLI sessions to autonomous agents for continuous trading insights?
