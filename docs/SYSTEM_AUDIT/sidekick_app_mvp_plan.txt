This is a phenomenal concept and an actionable breakdown! The idea of a “Sidekick” App for ChatGPT Users not only aligns with current trends but also fills a noticeable gap in how people organize and optimize their AI-driven productivity. Here's how we could take the next steps to dive deeper into the MVP roadmap or specific features:
MVP Roadmap
1. Define Scope
Start small by focusing on:
Conversation Logging & Organization:
Manual input of conversations (or bulk upload via file for now).
Basic tagging and filtering functionality.
Goal Setting:
Simple interface to set and track goals (linked to tags/conversations).
Notifications or reminders for goals (push notifications for mobile or email alerts).
Dashboard:
Basic metrics:
Total conversations logged.
Topics explored (based on user-defined tags).
Goals created vs. completed.
2. Build a Prototype
Frontend:
Use React for web or Flutter for mobile to develop a sleek, responsive interface.
Keep the UI minimal for now, focusing on functionality over aesthetics.
Backend:
Create a simple REST API with Node.js or Django.
Use PostgreSQL for structured data (conversations, goals, tags).
Prioritize security with user authentication via Firebase or Auth0.
Hosting:
Deploy on Vercel (for frontend) and AWS/GCP (for backend).
3. User Testing
Release to a small group of users (tech-savvy ChatGPT power users like yourself).
Gather feedback on:
Ease of tagging conversations.
Whether goal-setting adds value.
What metrics users want most on the dashboard.
4. Iterate
Based on feedback, refine features.
Introduce AI-driven tagging as an experimental feature (using NLP models to auto-categorize conversations).
Feature Exploration
1. Prompt Optimization
For the prompt library and feedback system, this can be introduced after the MVP:
Save prompts with categories like "Trading," "Programming," etc.
Use NLP-based scoring for prompts:
Clarity: Ensure concise, actionable wording.
Effectiveness: Match prompts to a user-defined intent.
Suggestions: Generate refined versions of prompts.
Example:
Input: “Explain Python to a 12-year-old.”
Suggestions: “Explain Python programming basics for a beginner in simple terms.”
2. Advanced Analytics
Track prompt usage, success rates, and completion trends.
Example Insights:
"Coding prompts account for 40% of your interactions."
"Your success rate increases by 25% when prompts contain X words."
3. Integrations
Early integrations could include:
Exporting conversation summaries to Notion or Google Drive.
Goal deadlines syncing with Google Calendar.
Next Steps
Prioritize MVP Features:
Should we focus first on conversation organization, goals, or dashboards?
Design UI Prototypes:
Would you like mockups for the app (web/mobile)?
Technical Collaboration:
Should I draft the backend architecture, database schema, or a React frontend to get things rolling?
Let me know where you'd like to start, and we can keep iterating on this vision!
