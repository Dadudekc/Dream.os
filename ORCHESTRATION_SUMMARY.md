## Workflow

The complete orchestration workflow has been implemented:

1. **Project Scanning**
   - The `ProjectContextScanner` examines the codebase structure
   - Language statistics and key component identification
   - Context preparation for prompt generation

2. **Task Generation**
   - Templates are loaded and processed with context variables
   - Tasks are created with unique IDs and metadata
   - Tasks are saved to the queue directory for execution

3. **Task Execution**
   - `CursorUIService` opens the browser and navigates to the target
   - Prompt is entered and executed in the browser environment
   - Results and screenshots are captured for validation
   - Execution metrics are recorded (time, attempts, status)

4. **Validation and Feedback**
   - Outputs are validated against specified criteria
   - Success or failure status is determined
   - Failed tasks are analyzed for potential requeuing
   - Validation results are recorded in task memory

5. **Visualization and Monitoring**
   - The TaskStatusTab displays real-time execution status
   - SuccessDashboardTab shows metrics and trends
   - Users can interact with tasks and modify execution parameters
   - Historical data is maintained for trend analysis

## Features and Capabilities

1. **Modularity and Extensibility**
   - Each component is designed with clear interfaces and responsibilities
   - Factory pattern for service instantiation
   - Dependency injection for flexible configuration
   - Event system for loose coupling between components

2. **Robust Error Handling**
   - Graceful degradation when components are unavailable
   - Simulation mode when browser automation isn't possible
   - Comprehensive logging throughout the execution cycle
   - Recovery mechanisms for failed tasks

3. **User Experience**
   - Real-time monitoring and feedback
   - Intuitive interfaces for task management
   - Visual representation of metrics and trends
   - Direct control over task execution and validation

4. **Performance and Optimization**
   - Efficient task scheduling and execution
   - Caching for context scanning results
   - Batched operations for UI updates
   - Configurable timeouts and retry logic

## Testing and Validation

The system includes:

1. **Simulation Mode**
   - Test the orchestration cycle without actual browser automation
   - Generate realistic outputs based on template types
   - Validate the event flow and component integration

2. **Demo Script**
