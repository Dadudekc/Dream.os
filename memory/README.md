# Service Initialization Fixes

This document describes the changes made to fix service initialization issues in the DreamOsMainWindow application.

## Issue Summary

The logs indicated that several key services were not available when the GUI (DreamOsMainWindow) was launched:
- prompt_manager
- chat_manager
- response_handler
- memory_manager
- discord_service
- fix_service
- rollback_service
- cursor_manager

This occurred because these services were not properly initialized or added to the services dictionary before starting the GUI.

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced DreamscapeService Initialization

In `interfaces/pyqt/dreamscape_services.py`:
- Added robust error handling for each service initialization
- Created an `_create_empty_service` method to provide fallback implementations
- This prevents NoneType errors by returning stub objects that log warnings instead of failing
- Fixed UnifiedDiscordService initialization to adapt to its expected parameters using inspect.signature
- Added appropriate parameter detection for different constructor signatures

### 2. Fixed Services Dictionary in Main()

In `interfaces/pyqt/DreamOsMainWindow.py`:
- Expanded the services dictionary to include all required services
- Added proper error handling during service creation
- Ensured service names match what's expected by components
- Added validation and logging for service availability
- Created a separate reference copy of services to prevent reference loss
- Added dictionary comprehension to automatically replace None values with EmptyService instances
- Improved diagnostic output to better identify service status

### 3. Improved MainTabs Initialization

In `interfaces/pyqt/tabs/MainTabs.py`:
- Modified the tab initialization to only pass expected parameters to each tab
- Used dictionary comprehensions to filter extra_dependencies to avoid unexpected keyword issues
- Ensured compatibility with all child tabs' constructors

### 4. Enhanced Application Error Handling

In `interfaces/pyqt/DreamOsMainWindow.py`:
- Added service verification in the constructor
- Added graceful shutdown for all services with detailed logging
- Improved error handling during closeEvent()
- Added better logging for service status during initialization and shutdown

### 5. Module Import Fixes

In `interfaces/pyqt/__init__.py`:
- Removed problematic relative imports
- Simplified the module exports

## Next Steps

1. Create a formal dependency injection system to better manage service dependencies
2. Add unit tests for service initialization
3. Create fallback UI modes when services are unavailable
4. Fix the remaining import issues with the module structure
5. Investigate the Chrome WebDriver connection issues with the CursorSessionManager

## Usage

The application should now start successfully with all available services and gracefully handle missing ones. Services that cannot be initialized will be replaced with stub implementations that log warnings when methods are called.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter "Service not available" errors:
1. Check the logs for initialization errors
2. Verify that the service classes exist and can be imported
3. Ensure that the service names in `services` dictionary match what's expected by consumers
4. Add diagnostic print statements to track service creation and reference consistency
