Okay, I need to generate complete and runnable unittests for the provided Python code using Python's unittest module. The user also mentioned including edge cases and mock external dependencies, but since they only asked for test code after that, maybe I should focus on writing tests.

First, looking at the CodeMetricsAnalyzer class. It has several methods: __init__, analyze_file, _calculate_complexity, _calculate_halstead, _calculate_maintainability, _get_test_coverage, and analyze_directory. Then there's get_code_metrics which calls analyze_directory.

I should write unit tests for each of these methods. But since the code is part of a larger project, I need to think about how to structure the test cases without causing import issues or environment dependencies in the tests.

Wait, but using mocks could help here. For example, when testing _get_test_coverage, instead of actually running pytest with coverage, which can be tricky and cause side effects, I can mock the subprocess.run call to simulate a successful run and return coverage data.

Also, for the analyze_file method, since it deals with file operations, I should test it with both valid and invalid files. Maybe create some test files that mimic real code and also some that shouldn't be processed (like binary files).

But wait, the user mentioned including edge cases in tests. So perhaps I can write tests without relying on external systems by using mocks for subprocess.run.

I'll start by creating a TestCodeMetricsAnalyzer class where each method under test is placed inside @classmethods decorated with setUp or something similar.

Wait, but since some methods might depend on other modules (like coverage), maybe it's better to mock those as well. For example, in the _get_test_coverage test case, I can mock the coverage module and the subprocess to simulate everything happening internally.

Hmm, perhaps for each method that has external dependencies, like running pytest, I'll create a mock object and setup the expected behavior.

Also, considering data files for testing might be necessary. For example, having some sample code to calculate metrics manually so that tests can assert against known values.

So, maybe I should include test files in the test suite. Like small snippets of Python code with known cyclomatic complexity, Halstead metrics, etc., and then check if the analyzer returns correct results for those.

Additionally, edge cases could involve empty files, single-line files, files with complex structures, or files where some calculations can't be computed (like an unreadable file), which should trigger exceptions. The analyze_file method has try-except blocks to handle such errors, so tests for that are also necessary.

Putting it all together, the test cases will:

1. Test each method's functionality.
2. Check exception handling in critical methods like analyze_file.
3. Use mocks where possible to avoid external dependencies.
4. Include sample data files to verify correct metric calculations.
5. Test edge cases such as empty files or unreadable content.

I should structure the tests with appropriate assertions for each returned value, ensuring that all metrics are correctly calculated and handled in case of errors.

So, I'll start by outlining test cases for each method:

- For analyze_file: Test with a valid Python file, check if all metrics are computed. Also, test an unreadable file to see if it returns the error metrics.
- For _calculate_complexity: Provide content that triggers different complexities and ensure they're correctly calculated.
- Similarly, test _calculate_halstead for various code snippets.
- Test _get_test_coverage by mocking pytest coverage run and checking coverage data.
- Ensure that analyze_directory works correctly by testing with a small directory structure.

Finally, include setup steps to create necessary test files if possible, but since I can't create files here, perhaps describe how they should be structured in the tests.

Here is a comprehensive suite of unit tests for the provided code using Python's `unittest` module. The tests cover various methods and handle edge cases while using mocks where appropriate.

This test suite includes:

1. **Setup**: Creates a temporary directory and mocks necessary modules to avoid external dependencies.
2. **Test Cases**:
   - **analyze_file**: Tests with valid Python files, empty files, and error cases.
   - **get_code_metrics**: Verifies metrics for multiple files, including expected errors.
   - **Helper Functions**: Unit tests for complexity calculations.
3. **Subprocess Simulation**: Tests how the analyzer handles unexpected subprocess returns.

The test suite ensures that:
- The analyzer correctly processes different file types (valid Python, minimal code, errors).
- Coverage and complexity metrics are accurately calculated.
- Error handling is properly tested with mocked scenarios.

To run these tests:

```bash
python3 -m unittest discover . -p "test_*.py" -v
```

Note: Adjust the sample content in `test_calculate_complexity` as needed for your specific use case.
