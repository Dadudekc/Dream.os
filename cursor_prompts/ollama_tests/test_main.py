Alright, I need to create comprehensive and runnable unittests for the provided Python code using the unittest module. The user emphasized including edge cases and mocking external dependencies. Let me go through each part of the code step by step.

First, looking at the imports and modules: they're importing logging, argparse, threading, time, and several PyQt modules. Then there are a bunch of services initialized in functions like initialize_services(). 

I'll start by setting up mock objects for external dependencies because mocking is crucial. The code uses argparse, so I'll create a mock for that. Also, since it interacts with web apps via start_flask_app(), I'll mock that function to return immediately without any issues.

Next, the setup_logging() function initializes logging configuration. In tests, I should ensure that logging behaves as expectedâ€”maybe test that logs are written correctly or that they don't interfere between tests.

The initialize_services() function sets up several services like ConfigService, PromptService, etc. For testing these, each service should be tested individually to ensure they work without interfering with other parts. But since some services depend on others, I might need a setup where all dependencies are provided correctly.

In the run_pyqt_gui() function, the PyQt part is extensive. Testing GUIs can be tricky because it involves UI components and their interactions. To make this manageable, I'll mock any GUI-specific calls or use QtTest if possible. However, since the user didn't specify using testing frameworks like pytest-qtn, I'll proceed with basic unittests, relying on assertions in the tests.

The execute_mode() function handles different modes: agent, gui, web, all. Each mode should be tested independently. For the GUI and web modes, mocking the web part as mentioned earlier would help isolate the GUI test.

I need to handle exceptions properly. Maybe create a test that triggers an exception in a service and checks if it's handled correctly without crashing the entire test suite.

Edge cases could include scenarios like multiple threads being started or services not being initialized properly. Testing these scenarios can be done by setting up mocks that fail or succeed under different conditions.

For each class, I'll define test cases covering normal operation and edge cases. For example, testing if an exception is caught when initializing a service fails.

I should also ensure that any external calls are mocked so that the tests don't rely on actual network traffic or other external factors.

Lastly, I'll structure the tests using the unittest framework, creating classes for each module under test. Each test method will set up the necessary mocks and dependencies before running the test case.

### Explanation of the Test Cases:

1. **TestInitialization**:
   - Tests the initialization of services using mocks for external dependencies like argparse and logging.

2. **TestSetupLogging**:
   - Verifies that the setup of logging handlers works correctly, ensuring logs are written to the appropriate handler based on log level.

3. **TestInitializeServices**:
   - Validates that all services (ChatManager, DriverManager) are properly initialized with mocks for their constructors.

4. **TestExecuteMode**:
   - Tests each execution path of `execute_mode()` including agent mode without GUI/web, GUI mode with app setup, and web mode with flask thread handling.

5. **TestFlaskAppSetup**:
   - Verifies that the Flask application is properly mocked and any errors are correctly propagated.

### Running the Tests:

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```

These tests provide a foundation for verifying the correctness of the provided codebase, ensuring proper initialization, logging, service setup, and handling of different execution modes.
